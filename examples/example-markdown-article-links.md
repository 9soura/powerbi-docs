# Example - Article-to-Article Links
This is a sample documentation article that is used to test and validate the publishing system for azure.microsoft.com.  

The content between the lines below demonstrates the use of markdown-to-markdown article links

This [link](example-azure-note.md) is to an example document that demonstrates the use of the AZURE.NOTE extension.  Notice that the link in markdown content is to a .md file.

This [link](example-headings.md#heading-2) goes to a markdown document with an anchor.

This [link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-content-test/blob/master/README.md) is absolute and should not change.
