Before users can connect to a SQL Server Analysis Services tabular model, a Power BI Analysis Services connector needs to be configured for the server.&nbsp; If you have more than one&nbsp;Analysis Services&nbsp;server, you'll need to configure one connector per server.&nbsp;This is done by a server administrator. For more detailed information about how the connector works, be sure to see <a href="http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/546004-power-bi-analysis-services-connector-in-depth">Power BI Analysis Services Connector in-depth</a>.</p><p>


Once the connector is configured, tabular model databases on the Analysis Services server instance will appear in the SQL Server&nbsp;Analysis Services page in Power BI. Creating the connection requires a Windows account and password with&nbsp;Server Administrator permissions for the server instance you are connecting to. Once configured, users will need to have at least Read permissions for any tabular model databases they’re connecting to. </p><p>


The connector can run on any domain computer. It doesn't have to be your local&nbsp;computer or the&nbsp;Analysis Services&nbsp;server, as it's just acting as a proxy between Analysis Services&nbsp;and Power BI.&nbsp;The connector makes the connection to Analysis Services&nbsp;and passes the credentials of the user accessing Power BI along to it. The&nbsp;computer where it is installed has to remain turned on, connected to the network, and able to access the Analysis Services&nbsp;server at all times.

</li><li>
The Analysis Services server is domain joined.
</li><li>
The Analysis Services connector &amp; Analysis Services server are installed on&nbsp;computers in the same domain.
</li><li>
If you use a .onmicrosoft.com email address, you'll need to sync your Active Directory to Azure Active Directory using Azure Active Directory Sync (DirSync).&nbsp;To learn more. see <a href="http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/546004-power-bi-analysis-services-connector-in-depth">Power BI Analysis Services Connector in-depth</a>.
