# Cleaning Irregularly Formatted Data

While Power BI can import your data from almost any source, its visualization and modeling tools work best with columnar data. Sometimes your data will not be formatted in simple columns, which is often the case with Excel spreadsheets, where a table layout that looks good to the human eye is not necessarily optimal for automated queries. For example, the following spreadsheet has headers that span multiple columns.

Fortunately, Power BI has tools to quickly transform multi-column tables into datasets that you can use. For example, using **Transpose** in **Query Editor**, you can flip data (turn columns to rows, and rows into columns) so you can break data down into formats that you can manipulate.

With a handful of transformations, including *promoting rows into headers* into to break headers, using **Fill** to turn *null* values into the values found above or below in a given column, and **Unpivot Columns**, you can cleanse that data into a dataset that you can use in Power BI.

Once your data is in a format that Power BI can use, by transforming and cleansing the data, you can begin to create visuals.

With Power BI, you can experiment with these transformations on your data, and determine which types get your data into the columnar format that lets Power BI work with it. And remember, all actions you take are recorded in the Applied Steps section of Query Editor, so if a transformation doesn't work the way you intended, you can simply click the **x** next to the step, and undo it.
