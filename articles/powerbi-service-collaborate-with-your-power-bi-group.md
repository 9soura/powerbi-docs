# Collaborate in Office 365 with your Power BI group

Probably the main reason you created a group in Power BI was to collaborate on dashboards, reports, and datasets in Power BI. But collaboration doesn’t end with groups in Power BI. Office 365 offers other group services such as sharing files on OneDrive for Business, conversations in Exchange, shared calendar and tasks, and so on. Read more about [groups in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/Create-a-group-in-Office-365-7124dc4c-1de9-40d4-b096-e8add19209e9).

>**Note**: Groups are only available with [Power BI Pro](powerbi-power-bi-pro-content-what-is-it.md).

## Collaborate in Office 365

Collaborating in Office 365 starts from the group’s workspace in Power BI.

1.  In Power BI, switch to the group’s workspace, so the group name is in the top-left corner.
