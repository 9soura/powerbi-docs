# Collaborate with your Power BI group

Probably the main reason you created a group in Power BI was to share and collaborate on dashboards, reports, and datasets in Power BI. Collaborating on data starts with connecting to files on your group’s OneDrive for Business. [Connect to your group’s files](powerbi-service-connect-to-files-on-your-groups-onedrive-for-business.md).

>NOTE: Groups are only available with [Power BI Pro](powerbi-power-bi-pro-content-what-is-it.md).

Collaboration doesn’t end with Power BI. It continues with other Office 365 group services, like sharing files on OneDrive for Business, conversations in Exchange, calendar, tasks, and so on.

Collaborating in Office 365 starts from the group’s workspace.

1.  In Power BI, switch to the group’s workspace, so the group name is in the top-left corner.
