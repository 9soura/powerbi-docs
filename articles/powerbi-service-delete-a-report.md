# Delete a report from Power BI

[← All about reports](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/topics/65157-all-about-reports)

Don't worry, deleting a report does not delete the dataset that the report is based on.  And any visualizations that you pinned from the report are also safe -- they remain on the dashboard until you delete them individually.

### To delete a report:

1.  If the Navigation pane, right-click the report to delete and select **Delete**.

2.  Confirm the deletion.
