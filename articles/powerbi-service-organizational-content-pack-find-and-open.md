# Find and open an organizational content pack in Power BI  

When anyone publishes an organizational content pack to your organization, to distribution or security groups, or to [Office 365 groups you belong to](https://support.office.com/article/Create-a-group-in-Office-365-7124dc4c-1de9-40d4-b096-e8add19209e9), it appears in your  content pack library.  Browse or search the content pack library to find and open organizational content packs.

## Open an organizational content pack  
[Power BI Pro](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing) users all have an organizational content pack library that displays content packs shared with their entire organization, to distribution or security groups, and to Office 365 groups they belong to.  

1.  From the left Navigation Pane, select **Get Data \> My Organization** \> **Get**.

2.  Don't see the content pack you're looking for? Tap in the search box and type keywords:  
	 ![](media/powerbi-service-organizational-content-pack-find-and-open/cp_searchbox.png)

3.  Select a content pack to reveal additional details.

4.  Select **Get it now** to add the content pack to your active workspace. New dashboards, reports, Excel workbooks, and datasets are starred with a yellow asterisk.

If the content pack has an Excel workbook, you may see a warning that you don’t have permissions to view the workbook. If so, ask the content pack owner to [share the workbook with you in OneDrive for Business](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-documents-or-folders-in-Office-365-1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c). 

The content pack is locked. You can [save your own copy of the dashboard and reports](powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-use-and-work-with.md). 

## Changes to the content pack  
If the content pack owner changes the content pack, and: 
 
- **You haven't made a copy** The content pack updates automatically.

- **You have made a copy** Your copy won't be updated.
