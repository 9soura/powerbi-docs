# Find and open an organizational content pack in Power BI  

When anyone publishes an organizational content pack to your organization, to distribution or security groups, or to [Office 365 groups you belong to](https://support.office.com/article/Create-a-group-in-Office-365-7124dc4c-1de9-40d4-b096-e8add19209e9), it appears in your  content pack library.  Browse or search the content pack library to find and open organizational content packs.

## Open an organizational content pack  
[Power BI Pro](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing) users all have an organizational content pack library that displays content packs shared with their entire organization, to distribution or security groups, and to Office 365 groups they belong to.  

1.  From the left Navigation Pane, select **Get Data \> My Organization** \> **Get**.

    The library displays all content packs published to the entire organization and published to groups that you are a member of.

2.  Don't see the content pack you're looking for? Tap in the search box and type key words:  
	 ![](media/powerbi-service-organizational-content-pack-find-and-open/cp_searchbox.png)

3.  Select a content pack to reveal additional details.

4.  Select **Connect** to add the content pack to your active workspace. New dashboards, reports, Excel workbooks, and datasets are starred with a yellow asterisk.

You may see a warning that you don’t have permissions to view the Excel workbook. If so, ask the content pack owner to [share the workbook with you in OneDrive for Business](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-documents-or-folders-in-Office-365-1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c). 

The content pack is locked when you first connect to it, but you can [edit and save your own copy of the dashboard and reports](powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-use-and-work-with.md). 

## Changes to the content pack  
If the content pack owner changes the content pack, and: 
 
- **You haven't customized the content pack** The content pack updates automatically.

- **You have customized the content pack** You receive a notification that there is a new version. You can go to the content pack library and get the updated content pack without losing your personalized copy. Now you'll have two copies: your personalized copy and the updated content pack.  In your personalized version, all tiles from the original content pack will be gone. Tiles you've pinned from other reports will still render.
