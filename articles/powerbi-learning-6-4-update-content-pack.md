# Update a Content Pack

*See how to update your content packs and push the changes to others in your organization*

As the author of a content pack, your edits or updates will affect the other people in your organization who are using your pack.

When you make a change a dashboard, report, or dataset that has already been published, you'll get a prompt that suggests you update the associated content pack. To do so, select the **Settings** icon in the top right-hand corner of the screen and choose **View content pack** from the menu. You will now see a list of the packs that you have authored. Packs that need updating will have a small icon next to their name.

Select **edit**, and make any necessary adjustments to the name, description, and contents of your pack. Select **Update** when you're ready.

Once the content pack has been updated, anyone else in your organization who is using the pack will get a notification indicating that the content pack has been updated and asking if they want to accept the changes or create a separate version.

In this way it's easy for a content pack author to manage changes and push them out to other users in their organization.
