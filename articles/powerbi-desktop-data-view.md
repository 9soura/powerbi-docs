# Data View in Power BI Desktop  
[← Power BI Desktop](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/topics/68530-power-bi-desktop)

Data View helps you inspect, explore, and understand data in your Power BI Desktop model. It's different from how you view tables, columns, and data in Query Editor. With Data View, you’re looking at your data *after* it has been loaded into the model.

When you’re modeling your data, sometimes you want to see what’s actually in a table or column without creating a visual on the report canvas, often right down to the row level. This is especially true when you’re creating measures and calculated columns, or you need to identify a data type or data category.

Let’s take a closer look.
