# Printing from Power BI

Print an entire dashboard, a dashboard tile, a report page, or a report visual from Power BI service. Reports can only be printed one page at a time -- you can't print the entire report at once.

>**NOTE**: Printing is only available in the Power BI service and not Power BI Desktop.

## Print a dashboard

1. Open the dashboard that you'd like to print.

2. In the top right corner, select the ellipses (...) and choose **Print dashboard**.

    > **NOTE**: The print dialog you see will depend on which browser you are using.

##  Troubleshooting

*   Q:I cannot find the **Print** button.
*   A:If you are using Power BI Desktop, printing is not supported.  Printing only works in Power BI service.


*   Q:I cannot print all the report pages at once.
*   A:That is correct. Report pages can only be printed one page at a time.


*   Q:I cannot print to PDF.
*   A:You will only see this option if you've already configured the PDF driver in your browser.    


*   Q:What I see when I select **Print** doesn't match what you're showing me here.
*   A:The Print screens vary by browser and software version.


*   Q: My printout isn't scaled correctly.  My dashboard doesn't fit on the page. Other scaling and orientation questions.
*   A: Things like scaling, margins, orientation, size are not controlled by Power BI. For help with issues like this, refer to the documentation for your specific browser.
