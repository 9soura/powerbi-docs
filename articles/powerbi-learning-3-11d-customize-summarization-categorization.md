# Customize Visuals with Summarization and Category Options

*See how to customize your visualizations with summarization and category options*

Power BI has two properties that you can set on fields in your model to help report and visualize in different ways, such as when you need to aggregate a field rather than create a sum.

Select a visualization on your report canvas, and then select a field in the Fields pane that you use in that visual. The Modeling tab will now contain a number of different options for formatting and using that field. For example, you could set the format to currency or percentage. Use the **Default Summarization** drop-down menu to change how a field is summarized, including displaying a sum, a count, or an average.

You can make similar changes when plotting locations on a map. Select your map, and then select the field in the Fields pane that you use for the Location value. Return to the Modeling tab, and use the **Data Category** drop-down menu to select the type of location on your list, including state, county, or city.
