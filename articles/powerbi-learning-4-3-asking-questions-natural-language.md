# Ask Questions of Your Data With Natural Language

*Learn how to ask questions and create new visuals with natural language*

Along with building reports and visualizations with Power BI, you can create charts and graphs just by asking simple questions. Perhaps not everyone in your organization has time to create a report from scratch, but everyone can easily search for the exact data they need.

To ask a question of your data, first open a dashboard in the Power BI service. At the top of the screen is an input box where you can ask questions about the displayed data. Clicking on the box displays prompts with some suggested terms based on your data, such as "YTD revenue". You can click on a suggested term to see the result, often displayed as a simple table or card.

You can also ask questions in a more natural language, such as "What was our revenue last year?" or "What product had the highest sales in March 2014?". Power BI will display its interpretation of your question, and then choose the best type of visual to represent the answer.

You can edit the answering visual by using the Visualizations and Fields panes on the right-hand side of the screen, including altering the layout, adjusting filters, and changing the field inputs. To save the visualization to a dashboard, select the pin icon next to the question input box.
