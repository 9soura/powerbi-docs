# Get data for Power BI

Dashboards, reports, and datasets are at the heart of Power BI. Connect to or import ***datasets*** from a variety of sources, including content packs, files and databases. Content packs provide "out of the box" connectivity to a number of popular services such as Salesforce.




Need help understanding the building blocks that make up Power BI?  See [Power BI - Basic Concepts](powerbi-service-basic-concepts.md).

## Power BI data sources

Power BI is designed to work well with a variety of data sources:

-   Data from [Excel and Power BI Desktop files](powerbi-service-get-data-from-files.md).

-   [Organizational content packs](powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-introduction.md), designed with dashboards, reports, and datasets specifically for your group or organization.

-   Content packs for services, if you have an existing subscription to that service. In addition to establishing a data connection, Power BI  provides pre-built dashboards and reports for each of these applications.

-   Connectors to 
-   databases and other datasets, such as [Azure SQL Database](powerbi-azure-sql-database-with-direct-connect.md) and SQL Server [Analysis Services tabular data](powerbi-sql-server-analysis-services-tabular-data.md).

**Tip**: Read [Important considerations for connecting to data.](powerbi-service-important-considerations-for-connecting-to-data-in-power-bi.md)

## How to get data

How you get data depends on the kind of data you're getting.

-   Starting from the dashboard to which you want to add the workbook data, select Get Data at the bottom of the left navigation pane.

## Now that you've got your data in Power BI



After you've connected to or imported a dataset, it's time to: 

-   [Explore the dataset](powerbi-service-explore-a-dataset.md) 

-   [View and create reports](powerbi-service-reports.md) 

-   [Add the most important information to your dashboard](powerbi-service-dashboards.md) 

-   [Use Q&A to ask questions on your dataset](powerbi-service-q-and-a.md) 

-   And more.
