# Data sources for Power BI

Data is at the heart of Power BI. Connect to or import *datasets* from a variety of sources, including content packs, files and databases. Want to read more about the building blocks that make up Power BI?  See [Power BI - Basic Concepts](powerbi-service-basic-concepts.md).

Power BI works well with a variety of data sources:

-   Data from [Excel, Power BI Desktop, and CSV files](powerbi-service-get-data-from-files.md).

-   [Organizational content packs](powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-introduction.md), designed with dashboards, reports, and datasets specifically for your group or organization.

-   [Content packs for services](powerbi-content-packs-services.md) provide "out of the box" connectivity to a growing number of popular services such as [Salesforce](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/integrations/salesforce). Connecting to these services requires an existing subscription to that application. In addition to establishing a data connection, Power BI  provides pre-built dashboards and reports for each of these applications.

-   Connectors to databases and other datasets, such as [Azure SQL Database](powerbi-azure-sql-database-with-direct-connect.md) and SQL Server [Analysis Services tabular data](powerbi-sql-server-analysis-services-tabular-data.md).

**Tip**: Read [considerations for connecting to data](powerbi-service-important-considerations-for-connecting-to-data-in-power-bi.md) for tips on successfully connecting to any data source.
