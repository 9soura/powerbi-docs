# Power BI Premium release notes

These are the June release notes for Power BI Premium, a dedicated capacity giving your organization or team more dependable performance, larger data volumes, and the ability to distribute content without per-user licenses for viewers.

## June release notes

- Usage metrics for the capacity admin portal may under-report usage in the capacity. We are working on enabling this.
- Dynamic row-level security (RLS) is not yet available for embedded use cases. We are working on enabling this.
- Distributing Power BI apps to users in other AAD tenants using powerbi.com is not yet supported. We are working on enabling this.
- Users of the Personal Gateway must upgrade to the latest version in order to continue refreshing their data in Premium workspaces.
- Imported datasets greater than 1 GB are not supported in Premium capacity at initial release. We are working on enabling this.
- Users must log in at least once to the Power BI service before they can be assigned as capacity admins or given workspace assignment permissions.
- When you republish an existing dataset to Premium capacity, Q&A may take 1-2 hours to reflect the changes. This also applies to scheduled refreshes for datasets in Premium capacity. We are working on improving this.
- Quick Insights are not yet available for datasets in workspaces assigned to a Premium capacity. We are working on enabling this.
- You may see transient cases where you achieve more Direct Query/live connection queries per second than what is included in your capacity SKU. You shouldn't rely on throughput above what is included in your capacity SKU.
