# Integrate a tile into an app walkthrough

## Introduction

In this walkthrough, you integrate, or embed, a tile into a web app using C# and the **Power BI** API, some JavaScript code, and an IFrame.

>**NOTE**: To get started with this walkthrough, you need a **Power BI** account. If you don't have an account, see [Sign up for Power BI]( powerbi-admin-free-with-custom-azure-directory.md).

To integrate a tile into a web app, you use the **Power BI** API, and an Azure Active Directory (AD) authorization **access token** to get a dashboard and tile. Then, you load the tile into an **IFrame** using the same access token. The **Power BI** API provides programmatic access to certain **Power BI** resources. See [Overview of Power BI REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn877544.aspx). The illustration below shows the general flow to integrate a tile.

Here are the steps to integrate, or embed, a tile into a web page.

>**NOTE**: This article shows the code used in the [Integrate a tile sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-CSharp/tree/master/samples/webforms/integrate-tile-web-app) on GitHub. To follow along with this walkthrough, you should download the sample. To run the sample, see [Configure the integrate a tile sample](powerbi-developer-integrate-tile-register.md#configure-sample) in the Register a web app with Azure AD step .

## Steps to integrate a tile into an app

- [Step 1: Register a web app with Azure AD](powerbi-developer-integrate-tile-register.md). You need to register your web app with **Azure Active Directory (AD)** so that Azure AD can identify your application when you need to access **Power BI** tiles.
- [Step 2: Get a Power BI dashboard](powerbi-developer-integrate-tile-get-dashboard.md)
- [Step 3: Get a Power BI tile](powerbi-developer-integrate-tile-get-tile.md)
- [Step 4: Load a Power BI tile into an IFrame](powerbi-developer-integrate-tile-load-tile-iframe.md)
- [Integrate a tile into an app code listing](powerbi-developer-integrate-tile-code.md)

## Next step

In the next step, you learn how to [Register a web app with Azure AD](powerbi-developer-integrate-tile-register.md) to get a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to authenticate the web app with **Azure AD**. A Client ID and Client Secret is used to identify your app in Azure AD. After you get a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, you can configure the [Integrate a tile sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-CSharp/tree/master/samples/webforms/integrate-tile-web-app). See [Configure the integrate a tile sample](powerbi-developer-integrate-tile-register.md#configure-sample).
