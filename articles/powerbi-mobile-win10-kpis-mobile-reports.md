The Power BI mobile app for Windows 10 offers live, touch-enabled mobile access to your important on-premises business information. 

![](media/powerbi-mobile-win10-kpis-mobile-reports/power-bi-ssrs-mobile-report.png)

[Create Reporting Services mobile reports](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652547.aspx) with SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher and publish them to the [Reporting Services web portal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt637133.aspx). Create KPIs right in the web portal. Organize them in folders and mark your favorites, so you can find them easily. 

Then in the Power BI mobile app for Windows 10, view the mobile reports and KPIs, organized in folders or collected as favorites. 

>**Note:** Your device needs to be running Windows 10. The app works best on devices with at least 1 GB RAM and 8 GB internal storage.
