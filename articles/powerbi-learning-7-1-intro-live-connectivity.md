# Introduction to Live Connectivity

*Discover the different reasons why you would want to establish a live connection between Power BI and your data source*

So far in these articles, we've connected to a data source, imported the data, and stored a cache of it within Power BI. However, there are other options when managing your data.

For example, if you are connecting to a data store such as an Azure Database or an Azure Data Warehouse, you can connect directly with a live connection. Any changes to the data are automatically detected and processed by Power BI. If you are using a particularly large or unusual data source such as HDInsight or Spark, then you can run queries directly against them so you don't have to deal with quantities of irrelevant information.
