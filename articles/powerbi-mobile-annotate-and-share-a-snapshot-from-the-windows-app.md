# Annotate and share a snapshot of a tile from the Power BI for Windows app

When you share a tile from the Windows app for Power BI, you're sharing a snapshot of the tile. Your recipients see the tile exactly as it was when you sent the mail. They can't open the dashboard. You can send snapshots of tiles to anyone — not just colleagues in the same email domain.

You can add annotations — lines, text, or stamps — to a tile before you share a snapshot. You can't save the annotations in the dashboard. They only show up with the tile you send in email.

### Annotate a snapshot

1.  On a dashboard, tap a tile to interact with it.

2.  To annotate a tile before you send it, tap the annotation icon in the upper-right corner of the app:

-   Tap the pencil icon to draw lines of different colors and thicknesses.

-   Tap the smiley face to paste stamps (like emoticons) on the tile.

-   Tap the letter A to type comments.

2.  In your mail app, type the recipients' email names, and modify the message if you want.

3.  Tap **Send**.
