# Take a tour of Power BI service (app.powerbi.com)
<!-- Shared newnav Include -->
[AZURE.INCLUDE [newnavbydefault](../includes/newnavbydefault.md)]






## View reports in the navigation pane

You can have more than one report-- as you add reports, their titles are added to your current Power BI workspace. Only one report can be open at a time.

Hover over and select a report to open it in the report editor.

### Tips and troubleshooting

- Don't forget that [creating a report](powerbi-service-create-a-new-report.md)  requires a [dataset](powerbi-service-get-data.md).  

- Make sure you understand the difference between [Reading View](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view.md) and [Editing View](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md). 

- Familiarize yourself with the report editor by [Taking a tour](powerbi-service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour.md).

- Modify how your reports display using [page display settings](powerbi-service-change-report-display-settings.md).

- Do you know the difference between filter, highlight, cross-filter, and cross-highlight? If not, see [Filter and highlight data in reports](powerbi-service-about-filters-and-highlighting-in-reports.md).

- [Focus mode](powerbi-service-move-and-resize-a-visualization.md) and [full screen TV mode](powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen.md) -- there is a difference.
