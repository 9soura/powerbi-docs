# Filtering, searching, and sorting content in Power BI
A combination of Power BI automated filtering, user tagging, searching, and sorting allows you to quickly find what you need in Power BI service.

>[AZURE.NOTE] To learn about filtering visualizations, see [Filtering and highlighting in Power BI](powerbi-service-about-filters-and-highlighting-in-reports.md).



## How Power BI filters your content

Power BI content includes dashboards, reports, workbooks, and datasets. There are several ways that Power BI filters the content to make it easier for you to organize and locate what you need. Content that you create is available in **My workspace**, content associated with a group is available in that group's workspace, content that is shared with you is available in **Shared with me**, and your last-viewed content is also available in **Recent**.

For more information, see [How content is organized in Power BI service](powerbi-service-the-new-power-bi-experience.md)

## Create featured and favorite dashboards

Another way to find what you need quickly is to identify your most-important dashboard and set it as the featured dashboard and set other commonly-used dashboards as favorites.

###   Featured dashboard

If you have one dashboard that you use most-often, [mark it as featured](powerbi-service-new-featured-dashboards.md).  That dashboard will always be available by selecting **Featured dashboard** from the left navbar. To learn more, see [Featured dashboards](powerbi-service-new-featured-dashboards.md).

###   Favorite dashboards

Similar to featured, if you have dashboards that you use more-often than others, [mark them as favorites](powerbi-service-new-favorite-dashboards.md). To learn more, see [Faorite dashboards](powerbi-service-new-favorite-dashboards.md).

## Searching and sorting in workspaces
A workspace has four tabs: Dashboards, Reports, Workbooks, and Datasets.  Each of these tabs contains a search field and a sort button.  Within any of these areas, you may end up with a long list of content.  Use searching and sorting to easily find what you need.
