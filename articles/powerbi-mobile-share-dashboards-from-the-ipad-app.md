# Share dashboards from the iPad app (Power BI for iOS)

You can invite colleagues to view and interact with your dashboards from the Power BI app for iOS on your iPad. You can also share [snapshots of tiles](powerbi-mobile-annotate-and-share-a-snapshot-from-the-ipad-app.md) with anyone, in or out of your email domain.

## Share a dashboard with colleagues

> [AZURE.NOTE]  The people you share dashboards with need to [sign up for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com), too.

1.  Tap the **Share** ![](media/powerbi-mobile-share-dashboards-from-the-ipad-app/pbi_ipad_shareiconblk.png) icon in the upper-right corner of your dashboard.

2.  Tap **Invite a colleague**, then type email addresses and a message to accompany your dashboard invitation.

3.  To allow resharing, leave **Allow recipients to share this dashboard** selected.

    > [AZURE.NOTE]    Allowing your colleagues to reshare means they can forward the email invitation to other colleagues, either through the web or the mobile apps. See [Notes about sharing dashboards](powerbi-mobile-share-dashboards-from-the-ipad-app.md#notes-about-sharing-dashboards), below.

4.  Tap **Send** in the upper-right corner.

Your colleagues get an email invitation with a direct link to the dashboard. The invitation expires after one month. When they open it, in a browser or in one of the mobile apps, it's added to their Power BI.

## Unshare a dashboard

You can only unshare a dashboard if you're the dashboard owner.

1.  Tap the **Share** ![](media/powerbi-mobile-share-dashboards-from-the-ipad-app/pbi_ipad_shareiconblk.png) icon in the upper-right corner of your dashboard.

    You see the list of colleagues with whom you've shared this dashboard. Below their names are these words:

    -   **Pending**: They haven't viewed the dashboard yet.

    -   **Can View**: They can view the dashboard but not share it.

    -   **Can View & Invite**: They can view the dashboard and share it with other colleagues.

2.  Tap **Edit**.

3.  To unshare, tap the red circle next to a name and tap **Delete**.
