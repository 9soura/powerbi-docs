*Power BI Desktop is a tool to connect to, clean, and visualize your data*

Power BI Desktop is our tool to connect to data and then model and visualize it in different ways. Most users who are working on Business Intelligence projects will spend the majority of their time using these tools.

Power BI Desktop connects to a wide variety of data sources, from local on-premises databases to Excel worksheets to cloud services. It helps you clean and format your data to make it more usable, including splitting and renaming columns, changing data types, and working with dates. You can also create relationships between columns so that it's easier to model and analyze your data.
