## October 2015

Read the [mid-October Power BI mobile blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powerbi/archive/2015/10/21/power-bi-mobile-mid-october-updates-are-here.aspx).

### All Power BI mobile apps 

- Line charts with a percentage-based Y-axis now calculate the visual range according to your actual data. The graph now starts from the lowest data point in the chart, instead of from a default value.

- Line, column, and bar charts can now have data labels.

## September 2015  
Improvements in the Power BI mobile apps -- Android, iOS (iPhone and iPad), and Windows. Read the [mid-September Power BI mobile blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powerbi/archive/2015/09/23/power-bi-mobile-mid-september-updates-are-here.aspx).

### Android  
-   Support for group workspaces: Collaborate with colleagues in group workspaces. 

-   Support for non-authenticated users:  For the few scenarios when users fail or can’t sign in to the app, we added a fast, convenient way to contact support and send feedback.

-   Improved user experience when accessing dashboards using role-based security.          

-   Improved data formatting of charts and alignment of all dashboard tiles. 

### iOS (iPhone and iPad)  
-   New & improved navigation: New drawer navigation maximizes screen real estate and improves navigation throughout the app. 

-   Group workspaces: Collaborate with colleagues in group workspaces. 

-   Authentication process upgrade Quality, performance, and functionality improvements enhance the app authentication process, including support for SSO (Single Sign-On). 

-   Improved data representation of line chart tiles to better compress the x-axis.

-   Improved user experience when using with role-based security.

-   Touch-optimized improvements for matrix chart tiles: Now you can easily scroll through your matrix data and view all its data easily and intuitively.

-   Improved data formatting of charts and alignments of dashboard tiles. 

-   Removal of iOS 7 support: To maintain highest security standards for Power BI, we will no longer support iOS 7 installed devices. iOS 8 and above is required. 

-   Send feedback and rating added in app: Added in-app capability to send feedback and provide ratings so that we can increase the community’s influence on our roadmap and promote issues easily and directly from the app.

### Windows   
-   Improved map tile rendering in in-focus mode to maximize screen real estate.

-   Improved user experience when accessing dashboards using role-based security. 

-   A new capability allows you to browse back and forth through dashboard tiles exploring them directly in in-focus mode without the need to return to the dashboard to select the next tile.

-   Additional stability and performance improvements.
