# Create a QR code for a tile in Power BI

QR codes in Power BI can connect anything in the real world directly to related BI information &#151; no navigation or search needed.

You can create a QR code in the Power BI service for tiles in any dashboard that you can edit. Then place the QR code in a key location. For example, you could paste it in an email, or print it out and paste it in a specific location. 

Colleagues you've shared the dashboard with can scan the QR code for access to the relevant tile, right from [their iPhone](powerbi-mobile-qr-code-for-tile.md) or from [their Android phone](powerbi-mobile-qr-code-for-android.md). They can use either the QR code scanner located in the Power BI app, or any other QR scanner installed on their phone.

## Add a QR code to a tile in the Power BI service

1. Open a dashboard in the Power BI service.

2. Hover over the tile and select **In-focus mode** ![](media/powerbi-service-qr-code-for-tile/fullscreen-icon.jpg).

4. From here you can scan the QR code or download and save it so you can: 

     - Add it to an email or other document, or 
     - Print it and place it in a specific location. 

## Print the QR code

Power BI generates the QR code as a PNG file, ready to print. 

1. Right-click the QR code image, and save the image to a convenient location. 

2. Download or open the PNG file on a computer connected to a printer.  

2. Print the file at 100% or “actual size”.  

3. Cut out the QR code along its gray frame and glue it to a place relevant to the tile.
