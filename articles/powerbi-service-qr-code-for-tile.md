# Create a QR code for a tile in Power BI to use in the mobile apps

QR codes in Power BI can connect anything in the real world directly to related BI information &#151; no navigation or search needed.

You can create a QR code in the Power BI service for tiles in any dashboard, even in dashboards you can't edit. Then place the QR code in a key location. For example, you could paste it in an email, or print it out and paste it in a specific location. 

Colleagues you've shared the dashboard with can [scan the QR code for access to the tile, right from their mobile device](powerbi-mobile-qr-code-for-tile.md). They can use either the QR code scanner located in the Power BI app, or any other QR scanner installed on their device. .

## Create a QR code for a tile

1. Open a dashboard in the Power BI service.

2. Select the ellipsis (...) in the top-right corner of the tile and select **Focus mode** ![](media/powerbi-service-qr-code-for-tile/fullscreen-icon.jpg).

2. Select the ellipsis (...) in the top-right corner and select **Generate QR code**.

3. A dialog box with the QR code appears.

4. From here you can scan the QR code or download and save it so you can: 

     - Add it to an email or other document, or 
     - Print it and place it in a specific location. 

## Print the QR code

Power BI generates the QR code as a JPG file, ready to print. 

1. Select **Download**, then open the JPG file on a computer connected to a printer.  

    > [AZURE.TIP] The JPG file has the same name as the tile. For example, "Opportunity Count - by Month, Sales Stage.jpg".

2. Print the file at 100% or “actual size”.  

3. Cut out the QR code and glue it to a place relevant to the tile.
