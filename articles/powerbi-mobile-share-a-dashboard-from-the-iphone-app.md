# Share a dashboard from the iPhone app (Power BI for iOS)

Invite colleagues to view your dashboards by sharing links from the iPhone app for Power BI. You can only share dashboards with colleagues in the same email domain as you.

## Share a dashboard

1.  In the upper-right corner of the dashboard, tap the ellipsis to open the dashboard menu.

2.  Type names, separated by commas, and a message to accompany your dashboard invitation.

3.  To allow resharing, leave **Allow recipients to share this dashboard** selected.

    >**Note**   Resharing allows your coworkers to forward the email invitation to others in your organization, either through the web or the mobile apps.

4.  Tap **Send** in the upper-right corner.

    Your colleagues get an email invitation with a direct link to the dashboard. The invitation expires after one month. When they open it, in a browser or in the iPhone or iPad app, it's added to their Power BI.

## Unshare a dashboard

You can only unshare a dashboard if you're the dashboard owner.

1.  In the upper-right corner of the dashboard, tap the ellipsis to open the dashboard menu.

    You see the list of colleagues with whom you've shared this dashboard, with these phrases:

    -   **Pending**: They haven't viewed the dashboard yet.

    -   **Can View**: They can view the dashboard but not share it.

    -   **Can View & Invite**: They can view the dashboard and share it with other colleagues.

2.  Tap **Edit**.

3.  To unshare, tap the red circle next to a name and tap **Delete**.
