# Introduction to Using Excel Data in Power BI

*Watch an introduction to the ways Excel and the Power BI service work together*

While the Power BI Desktop has many tools to connect to data and build reports and visualizations, you can also just directly use simple data such as an Excel spreadsheet.

You can upload your Excel files directly into the Power BI service, along with Excel tools like PowerPivot, PowerView, and PowerQuery. You can also refresh your data from within Power BI without ever having to open Excel.
