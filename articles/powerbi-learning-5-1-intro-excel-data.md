The following topics guide you through uploading an Excel workbook with a simple table into Power BI. Then you see how to upload workbooks created with Excel's more advanced BI data modeling and reporting features, such as Power Pivot and Power View.

You'll also learn some benefits of saving your Excel workbook files to OneDrive for Business. When you connect to Excel files on OneDrive from Power BI, your reports and dashboards in Power BI are updated and refreshed automatically when you make changes and save your work.
