# Introduction to Visuals in Power BI

*An introduction to visualizations in Power BI*

Visualizing data is one of the core parts of Power BI, and is the easiest way to find and share your insights.

Power BI has a whole range of visualizations available by default, from simple bar charts to pie charts to maps, and even more unusual offerings like waterfalls, funnels, and gauges. It also offers extensive page formatting tools, such as shapes and images, that will help bring your report to life.
