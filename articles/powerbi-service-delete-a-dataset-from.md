# Delete a dataset from Power BI

Datasets can be deleted.  When you delete a dataset:

-   If the dataset connects to a file in OneDrive, the connection is deleted but the file itself is not deleted from OneDrive.

-   Dashboard tiles that use the dataset are deleted.

-   Reports that use the dataset are deleted.

In the navigation pane, right-click the dataset to delete and click **Delete**.
