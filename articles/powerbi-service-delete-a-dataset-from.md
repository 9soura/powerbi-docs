# Delete a dataset from Power BI

You can delete datasets from Power BI.  When you delete a dataset:

-   If the dataset connects to a file in OneDrive, the connection is deleted but the file itself is not deleted from OneDrive.

-   Dashboard tiles that use the dataset are deleted.

-   Reports that use the dataset are deleted.

> NOTE: The only way to delete your connection to an organizational content pack is to delete the dataset. That deletes all related dashboards and reports.

In the navigation pane, right-click the dataset you want to delete, or select the ellipsis (...) and select **Delete**.
