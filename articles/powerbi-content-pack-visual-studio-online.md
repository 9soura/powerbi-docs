## Finding parameters 

Your account name is the front of your URL to visualstudio.com:    
    ![](media/powerbi-content-pack-visual-studio-online/URLimage.png)

Your Project name is the name you see at the top of every page in VSO:  
	![](media/powerbi-content-pack-visual-studio-online/Projectimage.png)

You can also use wildcards to select multiple projects. For example, you can select all projects by entering just “\*”, or all projects that start with “Azure” by entering “Azure\*”.

## Troubleshooting
  
When you attempt to login to your Visual Studio Online, you may receive a Login failed message.  
![](media/powerbi-content-pack-visual-studio-online/loginerror.png)

There are two common reasons why you may not be able to authenticate successfully:

1) You are signed in with a personal account, rather than your work or school account  

2) Your Visual Studio Online deployment does not support oAuth 

**Signing in with your work or school account**  
If you see this issue, it may mean that you’re already authenticated with Visual Studio Online under a different account than the account you’re trying to load data from – for example, if you have connected to Visual Studio Online with a personal Microsoft account, and connected to PowerBI with a work or school account.

To resolve this:  
-   Cancel out of the configuration dialog  
-   Sign out of Visual Studio Online under your personal account  
-   Sign into Visual Studio Online using your work or school account  
-   Restart the “Get data” process above  

Connecting with your work or school account (Azure Active Directory / AAD):  
    ![](media/powerbi-content-pack-visual-studio-online/vsologinscreen.png)

If you see this dialog, and you want to connect with your work or school account (Azure Active Directory), make sure to click the link on the left to sign in with that account – do not provide your AAD credentials on the right hand side, as that is expecting a Microsoft account (your personal account).

**Visual Studio Online deployments that do not support oAuth2**  
Your VSO administrator may have disabled oAuth for your Visual Studio Online deployment.  When this happens you will not be able to use the Visual Studio content pack for Power BI at this time.
