# Power BI Apple Watch app

With the Power BI Apple Watch app, you can view KPIs and card tiles from your Power BI dashboards, right on your watch. These types of tiles are best suited to provide a heartbeat measure on the small screen. Please note the blog post.
 
## Install the Apple Watch app
The Power BI Apple Watch app is bundled with the Power BI for iOS app, so when you [download the Power BI app to your iPhone](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=522062 "Download the iPhone app") from the Apple App Store, you're automatically also downloading the Power BI Watch app. The Apple guide explains how to [install Apple Watch applications](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204784).

## Sync your dashboard with Power BI on your Apple Watch
1. In Power BI on your iPhone, open the dashboard you want to sync with the Apple Watch. 

2. Select the ellipsis > **Sync with Watch**.

Power BI shows an indicator that the dashboard is synced with the watch.

You can only sync one dashboard at a time with the watch.

> **Tip**: if you want to view tiles from multiple dashboards on your watch, create a new dashboard in the Power BI service, and pin all the relevant tiles to it.

## Using the watch app
The Power BI apple watch app is accessible from the watches springboard or by clicking the Power BI complication (if configures) directly from the watch face:
 
"On the Apple Watch, the complications are the tiny widgets that sit next to or above the time. They could be an alarm, weather, sunrise times, or any other little doodad." 

The Power BI Apple Watch app consists of two parts
a.	Index screen
Allows a quick overview of all KPI and Card tiles from the synced dashboard
 
b.	In focus tile
Accessible by clicking a tile from the index screen this view Allows an in depth view of a specific tile:
 
6.	Power BI complication
Power BI Apple Watch app also supports displaying a tile directly on the watch face – so it is visible and accessible at all times.
The Power BI Apple Watch complication will remain up to date – and will update close to the time your data updates – keeping your needed information – at hand.
a.	Setting your complication
To set up a complication on your watch – please refer to the following apple guide:
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205536
b.	Changing the complication’s text
Given the very small amount of space on the Apple Watch’s watch face – the Power BI Apple Watch app allows you to change the title of the complication to suite the small available space.
To change the complications title, simply go to your Apple Watch control app on your iPhone, select Power BI and navigate to the complication name field:
 
Please note, if not changed Power BI’s Apple Watch face will default the number of characters in the title to meet the small watch face’s space requirements. 


Update your app to get these latest changes, other improvements and bug fixes.
