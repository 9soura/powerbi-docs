# Get data from the real world with the Power BI mobile apps
Power BI mobile apps can connect the real world directly to related BI information, in a number of different ways. 

## QR codes for tiles
Create a QR code for a tile in a dashboard, and put the QR code anywhere you want. When your colleagues scan the code with their iPhones or Android phones, they see the tile you've associated with that QR code &#151; on an iPhone, they see the tile in augmented reality.

## QR codes for reports
Create a QR code for a report.  When your colleagues scan the code with their iPhones (Android phones are coming soon), they see the report you've associated with that QR code.

## Barcodes
Tag barcode data in your report so your colleagues can scan a barcode on a product and go straight to that report, filtered for that product.

## Filter by location
Categorize geographical data in a report in Power BI Desktop. Then your colleagues view that report in the Power BI mobile app for iOS, Power BI automatically provides geographical filters that match where they are.
