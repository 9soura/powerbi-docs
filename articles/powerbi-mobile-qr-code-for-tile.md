# Scan a Power BI QR code from your iPhone

QR codes in Power BI can connect any item in the real world directly to related BI information &#151; no navigation or search needed.

Say a colleague has shared a dashboard with you, [created a QR code in the Power BI service](powerbi-service-qr-code-for-tile.md) for a tile in the dashboard, and placed the QR code in a key location &#151; for example, in an email or a specific location. 

You can scan the QR code for immediate access to the relevant tile, right from your iPhone, using either the QR code scanner located in the Power BI app, or any other QR scanner installed on your iPhone.

## Scan a Power BI QR code with the Power BI QR scanner

1. In the Power BI mobile app open the main navigation menu ![](media/powerbi-mobile-qr-code-for-tile/PBI_iPh_NavMenu.png) in the upper left. 

2. Scroll down to **QR scanner** and select it. 

3. If your camera is not enabled, you need to approve the Power BI app to use the camera. This is a one-time approval. 

4. Point the scanner at the Power BI QR code for immediate access to the tile. 

## Scan a QR code from an external scanner on your iPhone

1. From any QR scanner installed on your iPhone, point the scanner to the relevant Power BI QR code for immediate access to the tile. 

2. If you don’t have the Power BI app installed, you are redirected to the [Apple App Store to download it](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=522062).
