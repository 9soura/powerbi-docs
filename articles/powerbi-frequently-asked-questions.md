# Frequently asked questions about Power BI

## What is Microsoft Power BI?

[Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) is a cloud-based business analytics service that enables anyone to visualize and analyze data with greater speed, efficiency, and understanding. It connects users to a broad range of data through easy-to-use dashboards, interactive reports, and compelling visualizations that bring data to life.
