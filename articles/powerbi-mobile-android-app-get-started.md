# Get started with the Power BI for Android mobile app

The Android app for Microsoft Power BI delivers the mobile BI experience for Power BI, Power BI Report Server, and Reporting Services. View and interact with your company dashboards on premises and in the cloud from anywhere, with live, touch-enabled mobile access. Explore the data in dashboards, and share with your colleagues in email or text messages. 

![Dashboard in the Power BI for Android app](media/powerbi-mobile-android-app-get-started/power-bi-android-dashboard-optimized.png)

You create Power BI reports in Power BI Desktop, and publish them:

- [Publish them to the Power BI service](powerbi-service-get-started.md), and create dashboards.
- [Publish them on-premises to Power BI Report Server](reportserver-quickstart-powerbi-report.md).

Then in the Power BI app for Android phones, you interact with your dashboards and reports, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

## Enterprise support for the Power BI mobile apps

Organizations can use Microsoft Intune to manage devices and applications, including the Power BI mobile apps for Android and iOS.

Microsoft Intune lets organizations control items like requiring an access pin, controlling how data is handled by the application, and even encrypting application data when the app isn't in use.

> [AZURE.NOTE] If you use the Power BI mobile app on your Android device and your organization has configured Microsoft Intune MAM, then background data refresh is turned off. The next time you enter the app, Power BI refreshes the data from the Power BI service on the web.

Read more about [configuring Power BI mobile apps for Android with Microsoft Intune](powerbi-admin-mobile-intune.md).
