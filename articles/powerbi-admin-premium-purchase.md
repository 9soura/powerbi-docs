You can purchase a Power BI Premium capacity node through the Office 365 Admin center. You can also have any combination of Premium capacity SKUs (P1 through P3) within your organization. They provide different resource capabilities.

For more information about what Power BI Premium is, see [Power BI Premium - what is it?](powerbi-premium.md). To see the current pricing for Power BI, see the [Power BI pricing page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing/). You can also plan your costs for Power BI Premium by using the [Power BI Premium calculator](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/calculator/).

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Authors of content will still need a Power BI Pro license, even if you purchase Power BI Premium.

## Create a new tenant with Power BI Premium P1

If you don't have an existing tenant and want to create one, you can purchase Power BI Premium at the same time. The following link will walk you through the process of creating a new tenant for use with Office 365 and allow you to purchase Power BI Premium. You will need to purchase a Power BI Pro license for a user after the tenant is created. When you create your tenant, you will automatically be the Global Admin for that tenant.

To make this purchase, see [Power BI Premium P1 offer](https://signup.microsoft.com/Signup?OfferId=b3ec5615-cc11-48de-967d-8d79f7cb0af1).
