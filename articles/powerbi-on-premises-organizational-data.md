# Connecting to on-premises organizational data from Power BI

[← Get data](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/topics/63369-get-data)

![](media/powerbi-on-premises-organizational-data/importantIcon.png) **Important:** In Power BI Designer or Excel, you can query, import, and create reports from your on-premises organizational data from sources like SQL Server.  However, from Power BI, we currently do not support refreshing datasets connected to on-premises data sources. For more information about refreshing data in Power BI, see [Refresh data](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/474669-refresh-data). 

We know your own data is critical to making the right decisions. Power BI makes it easy to connect to your organizational data, whether in be on-premises or in the cloud.
 
Organizational data is often on premises. It’s in Excel workbooks on your own computer or in a fileshare system like SharePoint. Getting data from Excel workbooks is easy. See [Get Excel Data](https://powerbi.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/424871-get-data-excel-data).

Organizational data can also be in Analysis Services tabular models, created and managed by your IT department. In Power BI, when you connect to an on-premises tabular model, you’re using a *connector* configured by your database administrator. The connector hides some of the connection's complexities, allowing you to focus on getting right to the data you need to create your reports. To learn more, see [SQL Server Analysis Services Tabular data](https://powerbi.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/471633-get-data-analysis-services-tabular-model-data). For administrators, learn more about creating  connectors at [Configure a Power BI Analysis Services Connector](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/471577-configure-a-power-bi-analysis-services-connector-f) and [Power BI Analysis Services Connector in-depth](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/546004-power-bi-analysis-services-connector-in-depth).

To learn more about connecting to these and other data sources, see [Connect to data](https://powerbi.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/topics/63369-connect-to-data).
