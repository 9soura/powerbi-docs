# Create Custom Q&A Suggestions

*Discover to add your own questions to the suggested Q&A input box prompts*

With the Power BI service, you can add your own suggested questions for other users that they'll see when clicking on the search input box at the top of a dashboard.

To add your own questions, select the **...** next to the name of the dashboard that you want to use, and choose **Settings** from the menu. This will open the Q&A options menu. (You can also disable the Q&A search input box completely from this menu as well.) Select the **Datasets** tab, choose the dataset associated with your dashboard from the list, and select **Add a question** under Featured Q&A Questions. Enter your question or prompt into the input box and select **Apply**.

Now any time someone clicks on the search input box on the selected dashboard, they'll see your suggested entries at the top of the prompt list and it will take them right through to the Q&A answer. This is a valuable way to get dashboard users thinking about the type of data available and how they can best use it.
