# Publish Reports from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI Service

Publishing your reports to the Power BI service is fast and easy.

Once you've completed authoring your report in **Power BI Desktop**, just select the **Publish** button on the **Home** tab in Power BI Desktop, and the process begins.

Your report and data, including visualizations, queries, and custom measures, are packaged together and uploaded to the Power BI service.

>NOTE: It's common to refer to Power BI Desktop reports as **.pbix** files, which is the extension they're given in Windows.

Once the upload is complete, a dialog box tells you the publishing process succeeded and a link is provided in that dialog to take you directly to your report in the Power BI service, in a web browser.
