# Publish Reports to the Power BI Service

*See how to publish your completed reports to the Power BI service*

Publishing your reports to the Power BI service is fast and easy. Once you have completed authoring the report in Power BI Desktop, select the **Publish** button on the Home tab. Your report and data, including visualizations, queries, and custom measures, will be packaged together and uploaded to the service. Once the upload is complete, you'll be given a link to view your report in a web browser.
