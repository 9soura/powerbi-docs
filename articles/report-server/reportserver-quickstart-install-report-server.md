## Step 4: Browse to web portal

Now that you are configured, you should be able to open a browser to the web portal of your server. By default, this will be `http://localhost/reports`. You will also be able to browse using the machine name instead of using localhost by default, assuming you are not being blocked by any type of firewall.
