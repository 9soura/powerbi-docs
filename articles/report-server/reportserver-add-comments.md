# Add or view comments for a report on a report server

You can add comments to reports, including Power BI reports, within the web portal of a report server. The comments live with the report, and anyone who can see the report can see the comments.

## Add or view comments

1. Open a paginated or Power BI report on a report server.

2. In the upper-right corner, select **Comments**.

    In the Comments pane, you can see any existing comments.

3. Write your comment, then select **Post Comment**.

    Your comment shows in the pane on the web portal, along with any previous comments. They don't appear with the report on in the Power BI mobile apps.

    > [AZURE.TIP]Â Did you know? You can [annotate Power BI reports in the Power BI mobile apps](powerbi-mobile-annotate-and-share-a-tile-from-the-iphone-app.md) and share the annotated reports with others.
