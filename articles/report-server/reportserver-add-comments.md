# Add comments to a report in a report server

You can add comments to reports, including Power BI reports, within the web portal of a report server. The comments live with the report, and anyone with the right permissions can see the comments for the report. See the [Permssions](#permissions) section below for details.

## Add or view comments

1. Open a paginated or Power BI report on a report server.

2. In the upper-right corner, select **Comments**.

    ![Select Comments](media/reportserver-add-comments/report-server-web-portal-comments-button.png)

    In the Comments pane, you can see any existing comments.

3. Write your comment, then select **Post Comment**.

    ![Post Comment](media/reportserver-add-comments/report-server-web-portal-comments-pane.png)

    Your comment shows in the pane on the web portal, along with any previous comments. They don't appear with the report on in the Power BI mobile apps.

    > [AZURE.TIP] Did you know? You can [annotate Power BI reports in the Power BI mobile apps](powerbi-mobile-annotate-and-share-a-tile-from-the-iphone-app.md) and share the annotated reports with others.

## Permissions

Depending on your permissions, you can:

- Not see comments.
- See all comments, and post, edit, and delete your own.
- See all comments; post, edit, and delete your own; and delete other people’s.
