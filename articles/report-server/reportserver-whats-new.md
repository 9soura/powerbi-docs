## August 2017 (preview)

This preview release contains new capabilities.

You can download the August 2017 preview over at [powerbi.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/report-server/). This cannot be installed side-by-side with an existing Power BI Report Server. If you have Power BI Report Server already installed, the preview needs to be installed on a separate server.

### Non-Analysis Services data sources for Power BI reports

With the August 2017 preview, you can connect to any data source in Power BI Desktop and publish your reports to Power BI Report Server. To enable this functionality, there is no special configuration required. Simply install and configure the preview on your machine and you’re ready to go. You can then use Power BI Desktop to connect to your data source(s), create your report and publish directly to the server to share it with others in your organization.

There are a few limitations to keep in mind as you try out this preview.

- Scheduled data refresh is currently not available for reports using imported data.
- DirectQuery data connections are not currently supported.
- Scale-out environments are not officially supported.
- Reports must be smaller than 100 MB in size.

Support for these scenarios are planned for the GA release. The GA release is planned for Q4 of CY2017.

### Viewing and interacting with Excel Workbooks

Excel and Power BI contain a portfolio of tools that is unique in the industry. Together, they enable business analysts to more easily gather, shape, analyze, and visually explore their data. In addition to viewing Power BI reports in the web portal, business users can now do the same with Excel workbooks in Power BI Report Server, giving them a single location to publish and view their self-service Microsoft BI content.

We’ve published a [walkthrough of how to add Office Online Server (OOS) to your Power BI Report Server preview environment](reportserver-excel-oos.md). Customers with a Volume Licensing account can download OOS from the Volume License Servicing Center at no cost and will have view-only functionality. Once configured, users can view and interact with Excel workbooks that:

- Have no external data source dependencies
- Have a live connection to an external SQL Server Analysis Services data source
- Have a PowerPivot data model

### REST API for developers

A common ask from developers and administrators is to have an API to develop against, or automate actions, on the server for Power BI reports. In this preview, we’ve added a fully documented REST API that can be used for these scenarios.

### Support for new table and matrix viuals

The August 2017 preview includes support for the new Power BI table and matrix visuals. There is an updated Power BI Desktop release for the August 2017 preview. It cannot be installed side-by-side with Power BI Desktop optimized for Power BI Report Server from the June 2017 release.
