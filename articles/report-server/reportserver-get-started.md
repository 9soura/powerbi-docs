# Get started with Power BI Report Server

Create, deploy, and manage Power BI, mobile and paginated reports on premises with the range of ready-to-use tools and services that Power BI Report Server provides.

## Create, deploy, and manage reports

Power BI Report Server is a solution that customers deploy on their own premises for creating, publishing, and managing reports, then delivering them to the right users in different ways, whether that’s viewing them in web browser, on their mobile device, or as an email in their in-box.

Power BI Report Server offers a suite of products:

- A modern web portal you can view in any modern browser. In the web portal, you can organize and display reports and KPIs. You can also store Excel workbooks on the portal.
- Power BI reports, created with Power BI Desktop, that you can view within the web portal in your own environment.
- “Traditional” paginated reports so you can create modern-looking reports, with tools for creating them.
- Mobile reports with a responsive layout that adapts to different devices and the different ways you hold them.
