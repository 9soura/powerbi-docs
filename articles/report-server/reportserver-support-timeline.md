# Support timeline for Power BI Report Server

Power BI Report Server will be released a few times per year. Security and critical updates will available until the next release becomes generally available (GA). After the next release, the previous release will continue to receive security updates for the remainder of the 12 month release lifespan.

This support policy allows us to deliver innovation to customers at a rapid rate while providing flexibility for customers to adopt the innovation at their pace.
