# Introduction to Content Packs, Security, and Groups

*Get introduced to the tools that make sharing and collaborating easier with Power BI*

When you're working with Power BI as part of an organization, you often want to share and collaborate on reports, dashboards, and data. Power BI has a number of tools to make this easier.

Content packs allow you to package up dashboards and reports to send to other people, so they can build their own insights on top of your work. Groups allow you to subsets of users and design security policies around them to limit access to dashboards, reports, and datasets.
