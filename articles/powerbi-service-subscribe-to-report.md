# Subscribe to a Power BI report
When you subscribe to a report page, Power BI emails a snapshot of that page after the report refreshes -- but no more than once a day.

##  Requirements
-   **Creating** a subscriptions is a Power BI Pro feature
-   To create a subscription you must be the owner of the report
-   Subscriptions can only be set up any reports whose datasets have scheduled refresh set up, including:
    -   Direct Query (on-prem and cloud)
    -   Live connection
    -   Scheduled refresh (aka import)

##  Subscribe to a report page

1.  Open the report in [Reading view](powerbi-service-open-a-report-in-reading-view.md).

2.  From the top menubar, select **Subscribe**.

3.  You can subscribe to one report page at a time. Select the particular report page from the dropdown.

4.  Use the yellow slider  to turn the subscription on and off.  Setting the slider to Off will not delete the subscription. To delete the subscription, select the trashcan icon.

5.  Select **Save and close** to save the subscription. You will receive an email snapshot of this report page when the report is refreshed. If the report doesn't refresh, you will not receive a snapshot email that day.  If the report refreshes more than once a day, you will only receive the email snapshot after the first refresh.

##  Manage your subscriptions
There are 2 paths to the screen for managing your subscriptions.  The first is by selecting **Manage all subscriptions** from the **Subscribe to emails** dialog (see step 3 above). The second is by selecting the Power BI cog icon ![](media/powerbi-service-subscribe-to-report/power-bi-settings-icon.png) from the top menubar and choosing **Settings**.

The particular subscriptions displayed will depend on which workspace is currently active.  To see all of your subscriptions at once for all workspaces, be sure that **My Workspace** is active. For help understanding workspaces, see [Workspaces in Power BI](powerbi-service-workspaces.md).

##  Limitations

At the current time, subscribe is not available for content packs. The **Subscribe** button will be greyed out. But there is a workaround...make a copy of the report and add subscriptions to that report instead.
