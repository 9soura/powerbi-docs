# Work with organizational content packs

When an organizational content pack is published, all recipients see the same dashboard, reports, Excel workbooks, datasets, and data (unless it's an SSAS data source).  [Only the content pack creator can edit and republish](powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-manage-update-delete.md) the content pack.  However, all recipients can customize the dashboards and reports, and when they save their changes, a new *personalized* version of the content pack replaces the original.

## Edit an organizational content pack

Editing and saving changes to an organizational content pack creates a personalized version of the content pack, not visible to others.

1.  Open the content pack and make a change. Power BI lets you know that if you save this change you'll create a personal copy of the content pack.

2.  Select **Save**.  



## Help!  I can no longer access the content pack

This can happen for several reasons:

-   **Membership changes**:  Content packs are published to email distribution groups, security groups, and [Power BI groups based on Office 365](powerbi-service-groups.md).  If you are removed from the group, you will no longer have access to the content pack.

-   **Distribution changes**: The content pack creator changes the distribution. For example, if the content pack was originally published to the entire organization but the creator republished it to a smaller audience, you may no longer be included.

-   **Security settings changes**: If the dashboard and reports connect to on-premises SSAS data sources and changes are made to the security settings, your permissions to that server may be revoked.

## How are organizational content packs refreshed?

When the content pack is created, the refresh settings are inherited with the dataset.  When a group member creates a new personal version of the content pack, the new version retains its link to the original dataset and its refresh schedule.
