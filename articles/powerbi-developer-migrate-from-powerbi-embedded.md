# How to migrate Power BI Embedded workspace collection content to Power BI

Learn how to migrate from Power BI Embedded to the Power BI service and leverage advances for embedding in apps.

Microsoft recently [announced Power BI Premium](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-accelerates-modern-bi-adoption-with-power-bi-premium/), a new capacity-based licensing model that increases flexibility for how users access, share and distribute content. The offering also delivers additional scalability and performance to the Power BI service.

With the introduction of Power BI Premium, Power BI Embedded and the Power BI service are converging to advance how Power BI content is embedded in apps. This means you will have one API surface, a consistent set of capabilities and access to the latest Power BI features – such as dashboards, gateways and app workspaces – when embedding your content. Moving forward you’ll be able to start with Power BI Desktop and move to deployment with Power BI Premium, which will be generally available late in the second quarter of 2017.

The current Power BI Embedded service will continue to be available for a limited time following general availability of the converged offering: customers under an Enterprise Agreement will have access to through the expiration of their existing agreements; customers that acquired Power BI Embedded through Direct or CSP channels will enjoy access for one year from General Availability of Power BI Premium.  This article will provide some guidance for migrating from the Azure service to the Power BI service and what to expect for changes in your application.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] While the migration will take a dependency on the Power BI service, there is not a dependecy on Power BI for the users of your application when using an **embed token**. They do not need to sign up for Power BI to view the embedded content in your application. You can use this embedding approach to service non-Power BI users.

## Prepare for the migration

There are a few things you need to do to prepare for migrating from Power BI Embedded Azure service over to the Power BI service. You will need a tenant available, along with a user that has a Power BI Pro license.

1. Make sure you have access to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.

    You will need to determine what tenant setup to use.
    
    * Use your existing corporate Power BI tenant?
    * Use a separate tenant for your application?
    * Use a separate tenant for each customer?

    If you decide to create a new tenant for your application, or each customer, see [Create an Azure Active Directory tenant](powerbi-developer-create-an-azure-active-directory-tenant.md) or [How to get an Azure Active Directory tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-howto-tenant).

2. Create a user within this new tenant that will act as your application "master" account. That account needs to sign up for Power BI and needs to have a Power BI Pro license assigned to it.

## Accounts within Azure AD

The following accounts will need to exist within your tenant.

> [AZURE.NOTE] These accounts will need to have Power BI Pro licenses in order to use App workspaces.

1. A tenant admin user.

    It is recommended that this user be a member of all App workspaces created for the purpose of embedding.

2. Accounts for analysts that will create content.

    These users should be assigned to App workspaces as needed.

3. An application *master* user account, or service account.

    The applications backend will store the credentials for this account and use it for acquiring an Azure AD token for use with the Power BI REST APIs. This account will be used to generate the embed token for the application. This account also needs to be an admin of the App workspaces created for embedding.

    > [AZURE.NOTE] This is just a regular user account in your organziation that will be used for the purposes of embedding.

## App registration and permissions

You will need to register an application within Azure AD and grant certain permissions.

### Register an application

> [AZURE.NOTE] You should register the application using the application *master* account.

You will need to register an application as a native Azure application witn your Azure AD tenant. You can either register your application from the Power BI app registration tool, or directly within the Azure AD portal. For more information, see [Register a client app](powerbi-developer-register-a-client-app.md). Make sure that you select **Native App** for the **App type**.

### Apply permissions to your application

You will need to enable additional permissions to your application in addition to what was provided in app registration page. You can accomplish this through the Azure AD portal, or programmatically.

> [AZURE.NOTE] It is recommended you perform these steps using the application *master* account. It should be able to modify the app permissions within the Azure portal without admin rights. It will be the owner of the app.

#### Using the Azure AD Portal

1. Browse to the [App registrations blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ApplicationsListBlade) within the Azure portal and select the app that you are using for embedding.

    ![](media\powerbi-developer-migrate-from-powerbi-embedded\powerbi-embedded-azuread-app-permissions01.png)

2. Select **Required permissions** under **API Access**.

    ![](media\powerbi-developer-migrate-from-powerbi-embedded\powerbi-embedded-azuread-app-permissions02.png)

3. Select **Windows Azure Active Directory** and then make sure **Access the directory as the signed-in user** is selected. Select **Save**.

    ![](media\powerbi-developer-migrate-from-powerbi-embedded\powerbi-embedded-azuread-app-permissions03.png)

4. Within **Required permissions**, select **Power BI Service (Power BI)**.

    ![](media\powerbi-developer-migrate-from-powerbi-embedded\powerbi-embedded-azuread-app-permissions05.png)

5. Select all permissions under **Delegated Permissions**. You will need to select them one by one in order to save the selections. Select **Save** when done.

    ![](media\powerbi-developer-migrate-from-powerbi-embedded\powerbi-embedded-azuread-app-permissions06.png)

6. Within **Required permissions**, select **Grant Permissions**.

    This will give the app permissions on behalf of all users in the tenant/organization. If you don't want this, you will need to sign in interactively with your app ID to Azure AD at least once.

    > [AZURE.NOTE] In order to give permission to all users in the tenant, this operation should be made by an account in the Global admin role. Otherwise the permission is only granted to the user that performed the step.

    ![](media\powerbi-developer-migrate-from-powerbi-embedded\powerbi-embedded-azuread-app-permissions07.png)

#### Applying permissions programmatically

1. You will need to get the existing service principals (users) within your tenant. For information on how to do that, see [Get servicePrincipal](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/beta/api/serviceprincipal_get).

    > [AZURE.NOTE] You can call the *Get servicePrincipal* api without {id} and it will get you all of the service principals within the tenant.

2. Check for a service principal with your app client id as **appId** property.

3. Create a new service plan if missing for your app.

    ```
    Post https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals
    Authorization: Bearer ey..qw
    Content-Type: application/json
    {
    "accountEnabled" : true,
    "appId" : "{App_Client_ID}",
    "displayName" : "{App_DisplayName}"
    }
    ```

4. Grant App Permission to PowerBI API

    If you would like to grant permisions on behalf of all tenant users, you can run the following.

    ```
    Post https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/OAuth2PermissionGrants
    Authorization: Bearer ey..qw
    Content-Type: application/json
    { 
    "clientId":"{Service_Plan_ID}",
    "consentType":"AllPrincipals",
    "resourceId":"c78b2585-1df6-41de-95f7-dc5aeb7dc98e",
    "scope":"Dataset.ReadWrite.All Dashboard.Read.All Report.Read.All Group.Read Group.Read.All Content.Create Metadata.View_Any Dataset.Read.All Data.Alter_Any",
    "expiryTime":"2018-03-29T14:35:32.4943409+03:00",
    "startTime":"2017-03-29T14:35:32.4933413+03:00"
    }
    ```

    If you are using an existing tenant, and are not interested in granting permissions on behalf of all tenant users, you can grant permissions to a specific user by using the following.

    ```
    Post https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/OAuth2PermissionGrants
    Authorization: Bearer ey..qw
    Content-Type: application/json
    { 
    "clientId":"{Service_Plan_ID}",
    "consentType":"Principal",
    "principalId"= "{User_ObjectId}",
    "resourceId":"c78b2585-1df6-41de-95f7-dc5aeb7dc98e",
    "scope":"Dataset.ReadWrite.All Dashboard.Read.All Report.Read.All Group.Read Group.Read.All Content.Create Metadata.View_Any Dataset.Read.All Data.Alter_Any",
    "expiryTime":"2018-03-29T14:35:32.4943409+03:00",
    "startTime":"2017-03-29T14:35:32.4933413+03:00"
    }
    ```

    To get a list of users, you can use [List users](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/api/user_list).

5. Grant App Permission to AAD

    If you would like to grant permisions on behalf of all tenant users, you can run the following.

    ```
    Post https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/OAuth2PermissionGrants
    Authorization: Bearer ey..qw
    Content-Type: application/json
    { 
    "clientId":"{Service_Plan_ID}",
    "consentType":"AllPrincipals",
    "resourceId":"61e57743-d5cf-41ba-bd1a-2b381390a3f1",
    "scope":"User.Read Directory.AccessAsUser.All",
    "expiryTime":"2018-03-29T14:35:32.4943409+03:00",
    "startTime":"2017-03-29T14:35:32.4933413+03:00"
    }
    ```

    If you are using an existing tenant, and are not interested in granting permissions on behalf of all tenant users, you can grant permissions to a specific user by using the following.

    ```
    Post https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/OAuth2PermissionGrants
    Authorization: Bearer ey..qw
    Content-Type: application/json
    { 
    "clientId":"{Service_Plan_ID}",
    "consentType":"Principal",
    "principalId"= "{User_ObjectId}",
    "resourceId":"61e57743-d5cf-41ba-bd1a-2b381390a3f1",
    "scope":"User.Read Directory.AccessAsUser.All",
    "expiryTime":"2018-03-29T14:35:32.4943409+03:00",
    "startTime":"2017-03-29T14:35:32.4933413+03:00"
    }
    ```

    To get a list of users, you can use [List users](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/api/user_list).

## Create App workspaces (Required)

You can take advantage of App workspaces to provide better isoliation if your application is servicing multiple customers. Dashboards and reports would be isolated between your customers. You could then use a Power BI account per App workspace to further isolate application experiences between your customers.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] You cannot use a personal workspace to take advantage of embedding

You will need a user that has a Pro license in order to create an App workspace within Power BI. The Power BI user that creates the App workspace will be an admin of that workspace by default.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The application *master* account needs to be an admin of the workspace.

## Content migration

Migrating your content from your workspace collections to the Power BI service can be done in parallel to your current solution and doesn’t require any downtime.

A **migration tool** is available for you to use in order to assist with copying content from Power BI Embedded to the Power BI service. Especially if you have a lot of content. For more information, see [Power BI Embedded migration tool](powerbi-developer-migrate-tool.md).

Content migration relies mainly on two APIs.

1. Download PBIX - this API can download PBIX files which were uploaded to Power BI after October 2016.
2. Import PBIX - this API uploads any PBIX to Power BI.

For some related code snippets, see [Code snippets for migrating content from Power BI Embedded](powerbi-developer-migrate-code-snippets.md).

### Report types

There are several types of reports, each requiring a somewhat different migration flow.

#### Cached dataset & report

Cached datasets refer to PBIX files that had imported data as opposed to a live connection or DirectQuery connection.

**Flow**

1. Call Download PBIX API from PaaS workspace.
2. Save PBIX.
3. Call Import PBIX to SaaS workspace.

#### Direct query dataset & report

**Flow**

1. Call GET https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/collections/{collection_id}/workspaces/{wid}datasets/dataset_id/Default.GetBoundGatewayDataSources and save connection string received.
2. Call Download PBIX API from PaaS workspace.
3. Save PBIX.
4. Call Import PBIX to SaaS workspace.
5. Update connection string by calling - POST  https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/datasets/dataset_id/Default.SetAllConnections
6. Get GW id and datasource id by calling - GET https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/datasets/dataset_id/Default.GetBoundGatewayDataSources
7. Update user's credentials by calling - PATCH https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/gateways/gateway_id/datasources/datasource_id

#### Old dataset & reports

These are datasets/reports created before October 2016. Download PBIX doesn't support PBIXs which were uploaded before October 2016

**Flow**

1. Get PBIX from your development environment (your internal source control).
2. Call Import PBIX to SaaS workspace.

#### Push Dataset & report

Download PBIX doesn't support *Push API* datasets. Push API dataset data can't be ported from PaaS to SaaS.

**Flow**

1. Call "Create dataset" API with dataset Json to create dataset in SaaS workspace.
2. Rebuild report for the created dataset*.

It is possible using some workarounds to migrate the push api report from PaaS to SaaS by trying the following.

1. Uploading some dummy PBIX to PaaS workspace.
2. Clone the push api report and bind it to the dummy PBIX from step 1.
3. Download push API report with the dummy PBIX.
4. Upload dummy PBIX to your SaaS workspace.
5. Create push dataset in your SaaS workspace.
6. Rebind report to push api dataset.

## Create and upload new reports

In addition to the content you migrated from the Power BI Embedded Azure service, you can create your reports and datasets using Power BI Desktop and then publish those reports to an app workspace. The end user publishing the reports need to have a Power BI Pro license in order to publish to an app workspace.

## Rebuild your application

1. You will need to modify your application to use the Power BI REST APIs and the report location inside powerbi.com.

2. Rebuild your AuthN/AuthZ authentication using the *master* account for your application. You can take advantage of using an embed token to allow this user to act on behalf of other users.

    > [AZURE.NOTE] More information regarding the embed token will be made available soon.

3. Embed your reports from powerbi.com into your application.

## Map your users to a Power BI user

Within your application, you will map users that you manage within the application to a *master* Power BI credential for the purposes of your application. The credentials for this Power BI *master* account will be stored within your application and be used to creating embed tokens.

## What to do when you are ready for production

When you are ready to move to production, you will need to do the following.

- If you are using a separate tenant for development, then you will need to make sure your app workspaces, along with dashboards and reports, are available in your production environment. You will also need to make sure that you created the application in Azure AD for your production tenant and assigned the proper app permissions as indicated in Step 1.

- Purchase a capacity that fits your needs. You can use the [Power BI Premium calculator](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/calculator/) to help understand what you may need.

- Edit the App workspace and assign it to a Premium capacity under advanced.

    ![](media\powerbi-developer-migrate-from-powerbi-embedded\powerbi-embedded-premium-capacity.png)

- Deploy your updated application to production and begin embedding reports from the Power BI service.

## After migration

You should do some cleanup within Azure.

- Remove all workspaces off of the deployed solution within the Azure service of Power BI Embedded.
- Delete any Workspace Collections that exist within Azure.
