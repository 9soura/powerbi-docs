# Rename almost anything in Power BI service
This article teaches you how to rename a dashboard, report, workbook, dataset, and workspace in Power BI service.

## Rename a dashboard, report, or workbook
Dashboards, reports, and workbooks that you own can be renamed.  If it has been shared with you, you will not be able to rename it.

1.  Start in a workspace and select the **Dashboards**, **Reports**, or **Workbooks** tab. Hover over the item to rename, and select the gear icon ![](media/powerbi-service-rename/powerbi-cog-icon.png).

2.  Type the new name and select **Save**.
