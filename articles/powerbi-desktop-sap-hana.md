# Use SAP HANA in Power BI Desktop (Preview Feature)  

With Power BI Desktop, you can now access **SAP HANA** databases. To use **SAP HANA**, the SAP HANA ODBC driver must be installed on the local client computer in order for the Power BI Desktop **SAP HANA** data connection to work properly. You can download the SAP HANA ODBC driver from the [SAP download page](https://support.sap.com/swdc).

To connect to a **SAP HANA** database, select **Get Data &gt; Database &gt; SAP HANA Database** as shown in the following image.

When connecting to a SAP HANA database, specify the server name and the port in the format *server:port* - the following image shows an example with a server named ServerXYZ and port 30015.
