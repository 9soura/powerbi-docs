# Import PowerView and PowerPivot to Power BI

*See how to import your PowerView and PowerPivot worksheets into the Power BI service*

In the previous article we looked at how easy it is to take a simple Excel table and upload it to the Power BI service. If you are familiar with some of the older Excel BI capabilities, such as PowerPivot and PowerView, you can upload that content to Power BI as well.

Perhaps you're using PowerPivot to pull in data from different data sources, or to manage multiple tables that are in your Excel workbook. Maybe you used PowerView to create interactive worksheets. Power BI will detect these things, and translate them into a Power BI model.

Uploading advanced Excel worksheets to Power BI is the same process as with the more simple one: select **Get Data**, choose **Files**,  and then use the file browser to indicate the location of your Excel file. Once the Excel file has been uploaded and imported, your data will appear under Datasets (PowerPivot) or Reports (PowerView) as appropriate as fully functional Power BI content.
