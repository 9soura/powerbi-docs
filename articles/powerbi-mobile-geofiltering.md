# Filter a report by location in the Power BI mobile apps for iOS

When you look at a Power BI report on your iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch, do you see a little pushpin icon in the upper-right corner? If so, then you can filter that report based on your physical location.

## Filter your report by your location

1. Open a report in the Power BI mobile app on your iOS device.

3. Tap the push pin ![](media/powerbi-mobile-geofiltering/power-bi-geofilter-icon.png) in the upper-right corner. You can filter on either city, state/province, or country/region, depending on how the report creator set up the report. The filter only lists options that match your current location.

## Why do only some reports have location tags?
 because the report creator has tagged the geographic data in the report
When your colleagues create reports in Power BI Desktop, they can categorize geographical data for a column. Then, when you or your colleagues view that report in the Power BI mobile app for iOS, Power BI automatically provides geographical filters that match where you are.
