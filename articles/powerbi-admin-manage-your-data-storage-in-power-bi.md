# Manage your data capacity in Power BI

Power BI offers two licenses, Power BI (free) and Power BI Pro, with different data capacity limits:

-   Free users have a maximum 1 GB data capacity.

-   Pro users of Power BI Pro have 10 GB maximum capacity.

-   Pro users can create groups, with a maximum 10 GB data capacity each.

At the tenant level, total usage can’t exceed 10 GB per Pro user across all Pro users and groups in the tenant. 

Read about other features of the [Power BI pricing model](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing).

Included in your data capacity are your own datasets and Excel reports, and those that someone has shared with you. Datasets are any of the data sources you’ve uploaded or connected to, including Power BI Desktop files and Excel workbooks you’re using. The following are also included in your data capacity.

-   Excel ranges pinned to dashboard.

-   Reporting Services on-premises visualizations pinned to a Power BI dashboard.

-   Uploaded images.

    ![](media/powerbi-admin-manage-your-data-storage-in-power-bi/PBI_PersnlStorage.png)

    The datasets and reports are separated onto two tabs:

    **Owned by Me:** These are reports and datasets you’ve uploaded to your Power BI account, including service datasets such as Salesforce and Dynamics CRM.
	**Owned by Others:** Others have shared these reports and datasets with you.

3.  To delete a dataset or report, select the trash can icon ![](media/powerbi-admin-manage-your-data-storage-in-power-bi/PBI_DeleteIcon.png).


Keep in mind that you or someone else may have reports and dashboards based on a dataset. If you delete the dataset, those reports and dashboards won’t work anymore.

## Manage your group

    ![](media/powerbi-admin-manage-your-data-storage-in-power-bi/PBI_GroupStorage.png)

    The datasets and reports are separated onto two tabs:

    **Owned by Us:** These are reports and datasets you or someone else has uploaded to the group’s Power BI account, including service datasets such as Salesforce and Dynamics CRM.
	**Owned by Others:** Others have shared these reports and datasets with your group.

3.  To delete a dataset or report, select the trash can icon ![](media/powerbi-admin-manage-your-data-storage-in-power-bi/PBI_DeleteIcon.png).
	>**Note:** Any member of the group has permissions to delete datasets and reports from the group storage.

Keep in mind that you or someone else in the group may have reports and dashboards based on a dataset. If you delete the dataset, those reports and dashboards won’t work anymore.

## Dataset limits

## What happens when you hit a limit

When you hit the data capacity limit of what you can do, you will see prompts within the service. 

When you select the gear icon ![](media/powerbi-admin-manage-your-data-storage-in-power-bi/PBI_GearIcon.png), you will see a red bar indicating you are over your data capacity limit.

You will also see this indicated within **Manage personal storage**.
