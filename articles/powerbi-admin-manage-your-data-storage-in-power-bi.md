# Manage your data storage in Power BI

[← Administrative](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/topics/63248-administrative)

Power BI offers two licenses – free and Pro – with different storage limits:

-   Free customers have a maximum 1 GB data storage.

-   Pro customers of Power BI Pro have 10 GB maximum storage.

-   Pro customers can create groups, with a maximum 10 GB storage each.

At the tenant level, total usage can’t exceed 10 GB per Pro user across all Pro users and groups in the tenant. 

Read about other features of the [Power BI pricing model](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing).

Included in your storage limit are your own datasets and Excel reports, and those that someone has shared with you. Datasets are any of the data sources you’ve uploaded or connected to, including Excel workbooks you’re using as datasets. Reports are the Excel files you uploaded as intact Excel workbooks. Power BI reports and dashboards don’t take up any storage space. 

## Manage your own account storage

See how much data you’re storing in your Power BI account, and manage your account.

1.  To manage your own storage, go to **My Workspace** at the top of the left navigation pane.

2.  Select the gear icon ![](media/powerbi-admin-manage-your-data-storage-in-power-bi/PBI_GearIcon.png) in the upper-right corner \> **Manage Personal Storage**. 

    The top bar shows how much of your storage limit you’ve used.

    The datasets and reports are separated onto two tabs:

    **Owned by Me:** These are reports and datasets you’ve uploaded to your Power BI account, including service datasets such as Salesforce and Dynamics CRM.
	**Owned by Others:** Others have shared these reports and datasets with you.

3.  To delete a dataset or report, select the trash can icon ![](media/powerbi-admin-manage-your-data-storage-in-power-bi/PBI_DeleteIcon.png).


Keep in mind that you or someone else may have reports and dashboards based on a dataset. If you delete the dataset, those reports and dashboards won’t work anymore.

## Manage your group account storage

1.  Select the arrow next to **My Workspace** \> select the name of the group.

2.  Select the gear icon ![](media/powerbi-admin-manage-your-data-storage-in-power-bi/PBI_GearIcon.png) in the upper-right corner \> **Manage Group Storage**.

    The top bar shows how much of the group’s storage limit is used.

    The datasets and reports are separated onto two tabs:

    **Owned by Us:** These are reports and datasets you or someone else has uploaded to the group’s Power BI account, including service datasets such as Salesforce and Dynamics CRM.
	**Owned by Others:** Others have shared these reports and datasets with your group.

3.  To delete a dataset or report, select the trash can icon ![](media/powerbi-admin-manage-your-data-storage-in-power-bi/PBI_DeleteIcon.png).
	>**Note:** Any member of the group has permissions to delete datasets and reports from the group storage.

Keep in mind that you or someone else in the group may have reports and dashboards based on a dataset. If you delete the dataset, those reports and dashboards won’t work anymore.
