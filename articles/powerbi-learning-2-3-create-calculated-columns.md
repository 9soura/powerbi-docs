# Create Calculated Columns

*Creating columns is a simple way to enrich and enhance your data*

A calculated column is created by programmatically transforming one or more pieces of existing data. For example, you could create a new calculated column for "Full Phone Number" by combining the values from the "Area Code" and "Local Number" columns. Calculated columns are a useful tool for quickly creating models and visualizations.

To create a calculated column, select the **Data view** from the left side of the report canvas. From the Modeling tab, select **New Column**. This will open a formula bar where you can enter calculations using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) language. The Power BI formula bar will suggest specific DAX functions and related data columns as you enter your expression.
