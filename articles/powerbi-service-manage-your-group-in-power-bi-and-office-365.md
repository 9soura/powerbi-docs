# Manage your group in Power BI and Office 365

As creator or admin of a group in Power BI or in Office 365, you manage some aspects of your group in Power BI. Other aspects you manage in Office 365.

## Find the email address for your group

With the email address for the group, you can easily give all the members of your group access to your content pack. 

1.  In the Outlook for Office 365 view of your group, under **Groups** in the left navigation pane, right-click the group name \> **Copy email address**.

    ![](media/powerbi-service-manage-your-group-in-power-bi-and-office-365/power-bi-groups-email.png)

2.  You see the email address has this format:

    *yourgroupID*@service.microsoft.com. 

3.  Now when you create an [organizational content pack](powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-introduction.md), select **Specific groups** and paste your group's email address in the box.  

    When the group members go to **Get Data** > **My organization**, they'll find your content pack there.
