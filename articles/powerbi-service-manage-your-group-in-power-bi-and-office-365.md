# Manage your app workspace in Power BI and Office 365

As creator or admin of an [app workspace in Power BI](powerbi-service-what-are-apps.md) or in Office 365, you manage some aspects of the workspace in Power BI. Other aspects you manage in Office 365. 

**In Power BI** you can:

-   Add or remove app workspace members, including making a workspace member an admin.
-   Edit the app workspace name.
-   Delete the app workspace.

**In Office 365** you can:

-   Add or remove your app workspace's group members, including making a member an admin.
-   Edit the group name, image, description, and other settings.
-   See the group email address.
-   Delete the group.

You need a [Power BI Pro](powerbi-free-vs-pro.md) license to be an admin or member of an app workspace. Your app users need a Power BI Pro license, too, unless your app workspace is in a Power BI Premium capacity. Then business users can access your app with a Power BI free license instead. Read [What is Power BI Premium?](powerbi-premium.md) for details.

## Edit your app workspace in Power BI

1.  In the Power BI service, select the arrow next to **Workspaces** > select the ellipsis (**…**) next to your workspace name > **Edit workspace**.
