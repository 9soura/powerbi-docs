# Dashboards in Power BI service

##  What is a dashboard?

Dashboards, reports, and datasets are at the heart of Power BI service. And dashboards are a key distinguishing feature of Power BI service -- because you won't find dashboards in Power BI Desktop.  

***Dashboards*** monitor your most important data, at a glance.  A dashboard combines on-premises and cloud-born data, providing a consolidated view regardless of where the data lives. Each visualization, or insight, is displayed on the dashboard as a ***tile***.  Each tile on the dashboard is a snapshot of information taken from one or more underlying datasets. The tiles update as the underlying data changes. Learn how to [add tiles to a dashboard](powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles.md).

The image below shows the dashboard for the Retail Analysis sample. This is just one of the industry samples that we've pre-loaded into Power BI service for you to use for testing and learning. For more information about the samples, including how to open them, see [Sample datasets](powerbi-sample-datasets.md).

##  Working and interacting with dashboards

A dashboard isn't just a pretty picture. A dashboard is highly interactive and highly customizable. There are so many ways to interact with a dashboard, that one article couldn't possibly cover them all.  Please use the navigation to the left of this article to start exploring. If the table of contents item for **Dashboards** isn't already expanded, simply select **Dashboards** and then select **More** to display the full list of dashboard articles.

It's a long list.  Here are a few suggestions if you're just getting started.

**Create a dashboard**: Learn how to [create a new dashboard](powerbi-service-create-a-dashboard.md) and add tiles.

**Add tiles to a dashboard**: [Get data](powerbi-service-get-data.md) and [add tiles](powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles.md) and [images, videos, web code, and text boxes](powerbi-service-add-a-widget-to-a-dashboard.md) to your dashboard from reports, Q&A, SSRS, Excel, and more.

**Share a dashboard**: Learn how to [share a read-only version of your dashboard with your colleagues](powerbi-service-share-unshare-dashboard.md) and how to [co-own a dashboard among colleagues](powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-introduction.md).

**Dashboard size**: Display your dashboard without controls and menus using [full screen mode](powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen.md).

Dashboards can be wider and longer than the browser window. If so, they have scroll bars. Because you want to show everything important at a glance, we recommend making the dashboard fit the browser window. For more tips, see [Tips for designing a great dashboard](powerbi-service-tips-for-designing-a-great-dashboard.md).

**Working with Dashboards in the navigation pane**: Power BI can have more than one dashboard -- as you add more dashboards, their titles are added to the list under the **Dashboards** heading.  The dashboard you're currently viewing is highlighted. Only one dashboard can be open at a time.
