# Get started with the iPad app (Power BI for iOS)  

The iPad app for Microsoft Power BI for iOS is part of the mobile BI experience for Power BI and Reporting Services. With live, touch-enabled mobile access to your important business information on premises and in the cloud, you can view and interact with your company dashboards and reports easily, from anywhere. Explore the data in dashboards, and share them with your colleagues in email or text messages.  

![](media/powerbi-mobile-ipad-app-get-started/power-bi-ipad-sample-dashboard.png)

You [create dashboards and reports in the Power BI service](powerbi-service-get-started.md) with your data. 

Then interact with your dashboards and reports, explore the data, and share them, all from the iPad app for Power BI.

You can also [view Reporting Services KPIs and mobile reports for your on-premises data](powerbi-mobile-ipad-kpis-mobile-reports.md) in the iPad app for Power BI. You [create those KPIs and mobile reports with the SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652547.aspx).

## Download the iOS app for the iPad  
[Download the iPad app](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=522062) from the Apple App Store.

> [AZURE.NOTE]Â  Your iPad needs to be running at least iOS 9.0. 

## Sign up for the Power BI service

Go to [Power BI to sign up](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=513879) for the service, if you haven't already. It's free.

## Get started with the Power BI app 

1.  In the iPad, open the Power BI app.
  
2.  To view your Power BI dashboards and reports, tap **Power BI**. Sign in with the same credentials as your Power BI account on the web. 

    To view your Reporting Services mobile reports and KPIs, tap **SQL Server Reporting Services**. Sign in with your SQL Server Reporting Services credentials.

    ![](media/powerbi-mobile-ipad-app-get-started/power-bi-ipad-connect-to.png)

    >**Tip**: When you're in the app, tap the global navigation button ![](media/powerbi-mobile-ipad-app-get-started/power-bi-iphone-global-nav-button.png) in the upper-left corner to go between the two services. 

## Try the Power BI and Reporting Services samples  
Even without signing up, you can play with the Power BI and Reporting Services samples. After you download the app, you can view the samples or get started. Go back to the samples whenever you want from the dashboards home page.

### Power BI samples

You can view and interact with the Power BI dashboard samples, but there are a few things you can't do with them. You can't open the reports behind the dashboards, share the samples with others, or make them your favorites.

1.   Tap the global navigation button ![](media/powerbi-mobile-ipad-app-get-started/power-bi-iphone-global-nav-button.png) in the upper-left corner.
  
2.   Tap **Power BI samples**, then pick a role and explore the sample dashboard for that role.  

    ![](media/powerbi-mobile-ipad-app-get-started/PBI_iPad_Samples2.png)

    >**Note**:  Not all features are available in the samples. For example, you can't view the sample reports that underlie the dashboards. 

### Reporting Services mobile report samples

1.   Tap the global navigation button ![](media/powerbi-mobile-ipad-app-get-started/power-bi-iphone-global-nav-button.png) in the upper-left corner.

2.  Tap **Reporting Services samples**, then open either the Retail Reports or the Sales Reports folder to explore their KPIs and mobile reports.

    ![](media/powerbi-mobile-ipad-app-get-started/power-bi-reporting-services-samples.png)

## Search for a dashboard or report

* Tap the magnifying glass in the upper-right corner ![](media/powerbi-mobile-ipad-app-get-started/power-bi-ipad-search-icon.png), then type the term to find.

    ![](media/powerbi-mobile-ipad-app-get-started/power-bi-ipad-search.png)

    By default it searches all dashboards and reports, but you can search just one or the other.

## View your favorite dashboards, KPIs, and reports

You can view all of your favorite Power BI dashboards, together with Reporting Services KPIs and mobile reports, on the Favorites page in the mobile apps. When you make a dashboard a *favorite* in the Power BI mobile app, you can access it from all of your devices, including the Power BI service in your browser. 

-  Tap **Favorites**.

## Enterprise support for the Power BI mobile apps

Organizations can use Microsoft Intune to manage devices and applications, including the Power BI mobile apps for Android and iOS.

Microsoft Intune lets organizations control items like requiring an access pin, controlling how data is handled by the application, and even encrypting application data when the app isn't in use.
