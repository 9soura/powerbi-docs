# Data sources supported by DirectQuery

**Power BI Desktop** and the **Power BI service** have many data sources to which you can connect and get access to data. This article describes which data sources for Power BI support the connection method known as **DirectQuery**. For more information about DirectQuery, see [**DirectQuery in Power BI**](powerbi-desktop-directquery-about.md).

The following data sources support DirectQuery in Power BI:

-   Amazon Redshift
-   Azure HDInsight Spark (Beta)
-   Azure SQL Database
-   Azure SQL Data Warehouse
-   IBM Netezza (Beta)
-   Impala (version 2.x)
-   Oracle Database (version 12 and above)
-   SAP Business Warehouse (Beta)
-   SAP HANA
-   Snowflake
-   Spark (Beta)  (version 0.9 and above)
-   SQL Server
-   Teradata Database

Data sources that are have **(Beta)** or **(Preview)** after their name are subject to change, and are not supported for production use. They might also not be supported after publishing a report to the **Power BI service**, which means that  that opening a published report or exploring the dataset can result in an error.

The only difference between **(Beta)** and **(Preview)** data sources is that **(Preview)** sources must be enabled as a Preview feature before they become available for use. To enable a **(Preview)** data connector, in **Power BI Desktop** go to **File > Options and Settings**, and then **Settings > Options > Preview features**.
