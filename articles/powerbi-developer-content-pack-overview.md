# ISV Content Pack Authoring
A content pack is a set of out-of-box content allowing users to immediately gain insights from a source.  A content pack is typically focused on a specific business scenario providing insights for a role, domain, or workflow.

Content packs make it easy for your users to find insights and monitor their business data in Power BI.  They are prominent in the Power BI UI, provide default insight that help people leverage your product or service in a new and compelling way â€“ with immediate insight on data that matters to their every day jobs.  By building a content pack, in a way you are adding monitoring, exploration, and natural language search to your product.  The investment to build and maintain a content pack is smaller than if you would build or integrate similar capabilities directly within your own application.

Content packs allow domain experts can unlock the data, offering adhoc monitor and analysis to your customers without investing heavily in reporting infrastructure. It can also save time and effort, instead of building reports for each request, the content pack can be configured to support a wide-range of scenarios.

ISVs can build template content packs that allow customers to connect and instantiate with their own accounts. These template content packs are intended to eventually become publically available in the Power BI content pack gallery (app.powerbi.com/getdata/services). An example of the public content pack experience can be found [here](powerbi-developer-content-pack-experience.md)
