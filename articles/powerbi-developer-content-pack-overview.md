# Content Pack Certification Program Overview

A content pack is a set of out-of-box content allowing users to immediately gain insights from a source.  A content pack is typically focused on a specific business scenario providing insights for a role, domain, or workflow. 

ISVs can build template content packs that allow customers to connect and instantiate with their own accounts. As domain experts, they can unlock the data in a way that is easily consumable by a business users. The content packs allow offer adhoc monitoring and analysis to your customers without investing heavily in reporting infrastructure. These template content packs are intended to eventually become publically available in the Power BI content pack gallery (app.powerbi.com/getdata/services). An example of the public content pack experience can be found [here](powerbi-developer-content-pack-experience.md).

>**Note:** The Content Pack Certification Program requires access to the preview features and therefore initial approval through the [Microsoft Azure Certified](#Nomination) program to access. If you're interested, please submit a nomination.

2.	Build content in the Power BI Desktop
3.	Create a dashboard in PowerBI.com
4.	Test the content pack yourself within your organization

## Business Scenario
Content packs provide insights and metrics focused on a specific business scenario. Understanding your audience and the benefit they'll receive from the content pack will help ensure your users are successfully with the content you provide.

### Tips:
-	Identify your audience and the task they're trying to accomplish
-	Focus on a certain time period (last 90 days) or the last N results
