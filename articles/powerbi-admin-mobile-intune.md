# Configure mobile apps with Microsoft Intune

Microsoft Intune enables organizations to manage devices and applications. The Power BI mobile applications integrate with Intune to allow you to manage the application on your devices, and to control security. Through configuration policies, you can control items like requiring a pin for access, controlling how data is handled by the application and even encrypting application data when the app is not in use.

  

## Create a mobile application configuration policy

The mobile application configuration policy allows you to enforce items like an access pin. You can create one within the Intune portal. Within **Policy** > **Configuration** you can select Add... and under **Software** you can select Mobile Application Management for either Android or iOS. To get started quickly, you can select **Create a policy with the recommended settings**, or you can create a custom policy.

## Create the application

To add the Power BI mobile app to Intune, you can use these steps.

1. Go to the Intune portal and select **Apps** from the left menu.

2. Select **Add App**. This will launch the **Add Software** application.

3.
