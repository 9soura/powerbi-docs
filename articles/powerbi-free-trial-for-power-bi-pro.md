**Notes**

-   If you need more time to evaluate Power BI, you can request to extend your trial period for 60 more days.
-   Users taking advantage of this in-product Power BI Pro trial do not appear in the Office 365 admin portal as Power BI Pro Trial users (they appear as Power BI free users). They will, however, show up as Power BI Pro Trial users in the **manage storage** page in Power BI.
