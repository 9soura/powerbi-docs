# Dashboard tiles in Power BI  

A tile is a snapshot of your data, pinned to the dashboard. A tile can be created from a report, from a dataset, from another dashboard, from the Q&A box, and from SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS).

## What happens when I hover over a dashboard tile?  
Hovering over a tile reveals clickable icon that allow you to interact with the tile.

- Open the tile in full screen mode with the in-focus icon ![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/fullscreen-icon.jpg)

- Pin the tile to another dashboard with the pin icon ![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/pin-icon.jpg)

- Edit the title with the pencil icon ![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/pencil-icon.jpg)

- Remove the tile from the dashboard with the delete icon ![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/delete-icon.jpg)

- Resize the tile with the resize handle ![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/resize-handle.jpg)

- Use the column chart icon ![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/chart-icon.jpg) to open the report or Q&A query that was used to create the tile.

## What happens when I select a dashboard tile?  
When you select a tile, what happens next depends on how the tile was created and if it has a [custom link](powerbi-service-edit-a-tile-in-a-dashboard.md). If it has a custom link, selecting the tile takes you to that link. If there is no custom link, and you created the tile from:

-   **a report**: you go to a page in the report (in [Reading View](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view.md)).

-   **Q&A**: you go to the Q&A box with the tile and associated query active.

-   **a dataset**: if you saved the report in which you created the visualization, you go to a page in the report. If not, then selecting the tile produces no action.

-   SSRS: if you have permissions, the SSRS report manager page opens.

### If the tile was created in a Power BI report  
In the dashboard, select the tile.  
![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/PBI_DashTile.png)

The report opens.  If the report has more than one page, you are taken to the page that contains the visualization that was used to create the tile.

>**Note:**  
>If the original visualization used to create the tile changes, the tile doesn't change.  For example, if you pinned a line chart from a report and then you change the line chart to a bar chart, the dashboard tile continues to show a line chart.

### If the tile was created with Q&A  
In the dashboard, select the tile.  
![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/PBI_DashTileQnA.png)

Q&A opens with the question that was used to create the visualization, displaying the visualization.
