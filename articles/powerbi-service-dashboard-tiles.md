# Dashboard tiles in Power BI  

A tile is a snapshot of your data, pinned to the dashboard. A tile can be created from a report, dataset, dashboard, from the Q&A box, Excel, and from SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), and more.

## How do I create a tile?

Tiles can be pinned to dashboards from reports, Q&A, SSRS, Excel, and more.

1. When you select an item to pin, Power BI opens the **Pin to dashboard** screen.

    ![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/PBI_themes2.png)

2. Decide whether to pin to an existing dashboard or new dashboard. If existing, select the dashboard name from the dropdown.  If new, enter the name for the new dashboard.

3. In some cases, the item you are pinning may have a *theme* already applied.  For example, visuals pinned from an Excel workbook. If so, select which theme to apply to the tile.

## What happens when I hover over a dashboard tile?  

Hovering over a tile reveals the ellipses (...) and resize handle. Hovering also allows you to move the tile.

- [Resize the tile with the resize handle](powerbi-service-edit-a-tile-in-a-dashboard) ![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/resize-handle.jpg)

- Move the tile by selecting and dragging the tile to a new location on the dashboard.

- Select the ellipses (...) to open the action menu. Depending on how the tile was created (see above), you'll be able to do most, or all, of the following:

  ![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/tile-menu.png)

  - Open the tile in [Focus mode](powerbi-service-display-dash-in-focus-mode.md) ![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/fullscreen-icon.jpg)

  - [Pin the tile to another dashboard with the pin icon](powerbi-service-pin-a-tile-from-one-dashboard-to-another.md)

  - [Export the data used in the tile](powerbi-service-export-data.md)

  - [Edit the title with the pencil icon](powerbi-service-edit-a-tile-in-a-dashboard.md)
 ![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/pencil-icon.jpg)

  - [Remove the tile from the dashboard with the delete icon](powerbi-service-edit-a-tile-in-a-dashboard.md)
 ![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/trash-icon.png)

  - Select the arrow icon ![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/goto-report.png) or the column chart **Go To Report** icon ![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/chart-icon.jpg) to open the report or Q&A query that was used to create the tile.

  - Close the action menu by selecting the X icon ![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/delete-icon.jpg).

## What happens when I select a dashboard tile?  
When you select a tile, what happens next depends on how the tile was created and if it has a [custom link](powerbi-service-edit-a-tile-in-a-dashboard.md). If it has a custom link, selecting the tile takes you to that link. If there is no custom link, and you created the tile from:

-   **a report**: you go to a page in the report (in [Reading View](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view.md)).

-   **Q&A**: you go to the Q&A box with the tile and associated query active.

-   **a dataset**: if you saved the report in which you created the visualization, you go to a page in the report. If not, then selecting the tile produces no action.

- **An Excel workbook on OneDrive for Business**: if you have at least Read permissions for that workbook, it will open in Excel Online.

-   **SSRS**: [if you have permissions, the SSRS report manager page opens](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt604784.aspx).

### If the tile was created in a Power BI report or dataset Explore mode  
In the dashboard, select the tile.  
![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/PBI_DashTile.png)

The report opens.  If the report has more than one page, you are taken to the page that contains the visualization that was used to create the tile.  
![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/PBI_DashTileRept.png)

>**Note:**  
>If the original visualization used to create the tile changes, the tile doesn't change.  For example, if you pinned a line chart from a report and then you change the line chart to a bar chart, the dashboard tile continues to show a line chart.

### If the tile was created with Q&A  
In the dashboard, select the tile.  
![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/PBI_DashTileQnA.png)

Q&A opens with the question that was used to create the visualization, displaying the visualization.  
![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/PBI_DashTileQnAQuestion.png)

### If the tile was created from an Excel workbook on OneDrive for Business

In the dashboard, select the tile.

![](media/powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles/PBI_DashWorkbookTileSelect.png)  

If you have at least Read permissions for the workbook, it will open in Power BI.
