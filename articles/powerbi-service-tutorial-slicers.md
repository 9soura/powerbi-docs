# Tutorial: Slicers in Power BI  

A Slicer narrows the portion of the dataset shown in the other visualizations on the page.  Slicers are an alternate way of filtering.

## When to use a slicer  
Slicers are a great choice:

-   to display commonly-used or important filters on the report canvas for easier access.

-   to make it easier to see the current filtered state without having to open a drop-down list to find the filtering details.

- When you want to hide columns you don't need but still be able to use them to filter - this makes for narrower, cleaner tables.

- to create more focused reports - since slicers are floating objects you can put them next to the interesting part of the report you want your users to focus on.

## Create a slicer

1.  Open the Retail Analysis Sample in [Editing View](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md) and [add a new report page](powerbi-service-add-a-page-to-a-report.md).

2. From the Fields pane, select **District > District Manager**.

3.  Convert the visualization to a slicer. In the Visualizations pane, select the slicer icon

## Format the slicer.

1. With the slicer selected, in the Visualizations pane, select the paint brush icon ![](media/powerbi-service-tutorial-slicers/PBI_paintbrush.png) to display the Format options.

2. Select **General > Outline color** and choose dark blue and change the **Weight** to **6**.

3. Under **Selection Controls**, by default, **Select All** is **Off** and **Single Select** is **On**. This means that I have to use the CTRL key to select more than one name at a time.

  Turn **Select All** to **On** and **Single Select** to **Off**.

  - Notice that the slicer now has a **Select All** option at the top of the list. Toggle **Select All** to select all of the names or to select none of the names.

  - And you can now select more than one name without having to use the CTRL key.

4. Under **Rows**, increase the font to 14pt.  We want to be sure that our colleagues notice this slicer.

5. Lastly, set **Font color** to a dark red.  This will distinguish the selected names from the unselected names in our slicer.

## Use the slicer in a report

1. Add some additional visualizations to the report page.

2. Slice the report page for Allan and Brad. Notice how the other visualizations update to reflect these selections.

3. Sort the slicer alphabetically by District Manager last name.  Select the ellipses (...) in the top right corner of the slicer and choose **District Manager**.
