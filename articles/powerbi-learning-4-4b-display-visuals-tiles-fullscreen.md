# Display Visuals and Tiles Full-Screen

*Learn how to get a full-screen view of select report visuals and dashboard tiles*

When you're looking at Power BI dashboards or reports in the service, it can sometimes be helpful to focus on an individual chart or visualization. You can do that in two different ways.

When you're on a dashboard, hover over a tile to see a few different icon options in the top right-hand corner. The left-most icon is labeled **in-focus mode**. Select it to expand the tile to encompass the full dashboard space. In-focus mode allows you to see a lot more detail on your visuals and legends. You can pin the visual directly from in-focus mode to a different dashboard by selecting the pin icon.

The process is similar from a report. Hover over a visual to see the **Pop out** icon in the top right-hand corner. Selecting this will expand your visualization to encompass the full report canvas. The visual is still interactive in this mode, although obviously you will lose any cross-filter effect between visualizations.

Hover over an expanded tile or report and select the **Pop in** icon in the top right-hand corner to return to the previous view.
