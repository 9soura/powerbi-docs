# View your data offline in the Power BI for Android app

One advantage of viewing Power BI in a mobile app rather than in a mobile browser is that you can see your data even when you're not connected to a network. By default, Power BI refreshes the data frequently so you get up-to-date answers to your business questions any time, even while commuting or roaming.

## Data access while offline

While you're offline, you have access to and can interact with all of the dashboards in your **My Workspace**, as well as to any dashboard you've accessed previously from the mobile app.

You also have read-only access to any Power BI reports you've accessed previously from the mobile app. You can see the full report, but not filter, cross-filter, sort, or use slicers on it.

Power BI runs a scheduled refresh process every two hours, to make sure that the data is up to date when you view it offline, even if you didn't manually refresh it or view it before going offline. If you don't want Power BI to run the scheduled refresh, for example to avoid network usage, you can turn in off. Check the settings on your device.

## Offline indicators

Power BI provides clear indicators when you go in and out of offline mode, as well as indicators for missing dashboards, reports, and tiles that aren't available offline.

## Limitations
When you're offline with Power BI on your mobile device, you may encounter a few limitations:

-   Power BI can cache up to 250 MB of data offline.
-   Some tile types require an active server connection, so they aren't available offline &#151; for example, Bing tiles and some custom tiles.
-   Whole Excel workbooks in Power BI aren't available offline.
