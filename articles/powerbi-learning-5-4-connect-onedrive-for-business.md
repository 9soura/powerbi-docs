# Connect OneDrive for Business to Power BI

*See how to connect your OneDrive for Business workbook to easily import or connect your Excel files*

When you use OneDrive for Business as a place to store Excel files that you have connected to Power BI, it creates a kind of live connection. Any changes that happen to an Excel file will automatically be synchronized to the Power BI service.

To connect to a workbook on OneDrive for Business, log into the Power BI service and select **Get Data**. Choose **Files** under Import or Connect to Data, and then select **OneDrive - Business**. Highlight the desired file, and select **Connect**. At this point you can either **Import** the file, which will create connected datasets and reports in Power BI, or **Connect** to the file, which lets you view your Excel content through Power BI without importing and connecting the data.

Note that for imported files, any changes in the Excel source file will overwrite changes made in Power BI.

Workbooks that are connected (not imported) will have a small Excel icon next to their name in the Reports list. Select the ellipsis menu next to the connected workbook name to view and edit your data through Excel services, and schedule refreshes.
