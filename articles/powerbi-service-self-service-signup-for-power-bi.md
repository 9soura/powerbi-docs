# Self-service sign up for Power BI

Signing up for Power BI, as an individual, is easy! You can choose to use a free account, a Pro trial account, or purchase Power BI Pro, even if you are in an existing organization. Once you have determined which you would like to use, this article will walk you through the steps to get up and running.

> **Note:** If you are in an organization, individual sign up may be disabled. See [#individual-sign-up-has-been-turned-off] for more information if you get an error indicating it has been turned off.

## What email address can be used with Power BI?

Power BI requires that you use a work, or school, email address to sign up. Power BI does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com and others.

If you try to sign up with a personal email address, you will get a message indicating to use a work or school email address.

> **Note:** Power BI does not support self-service sign-up for .gov or .mil addresses at this time. Please contact your O365 admin.

## Individual Sign up has been turned off

When trying to sign up for Power BI, you may encounter the following message.

    Your IT department has turned off signup for Microsoft Power BI.
 
![](media/powerbi-service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi/allowadhocsubscriptionfalse.png)

This could be because your organization has disabled individual sign ups. It could also be because you purchased Office 365 through a partner. [Learn more](powerbi-admin-syndication-partner.md).

If your organization has disabled individual sign ups, you will need to work with your IT group to get a Power BI license assigned to your account in order to continue.

## Troubleshooting

In many cases, registering for Power BI can be achieved by following the simple self-service signup process listed above. However, there are several reasons why you may not be able to complete self-service signup.  The table below summarizes some of the most common reasons you may not be able to complete signup and ways you can workaround these issues.

| **Symptom / Error Message** | **Cause and Workaround** |
|---|---|
| **Personal email addresses (e.g. nancy@gmail.com)** You receive a message like the following during signup: <br /><br /> *You entered a personal email address: Please enter your work email address so we can securely store your company's data.* <br /><br /> or <br /><br /> *That looks like a personal email address. Enter your work address so we can connect you with others in your company. And don’t worry. We won’t share your address with anyone.* | Power BI does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunications providers. <br /><br /> To complete signup, try again using an email address assigned by your work or school. <br /><br /> If you still can't sign up and are willing to complete a more advanced setup process, you can [register for a new Office 365 trial subscription and use that email address to sign up](powerbi-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md). |
| **.gov or .mil email addresses** You receive a message like the following during signup: <br /><br /> *Power BI unavailable: Power BI is not available for users with .gov or .mil email addresses at this time. Use another work email address or check back later.* <br /><br /> or <br /><br /> *We can't finish signing you up. It looks like Microsoft Power BI isn't currently available for your work or school.* | Power BI does not support self-service sign-up for .gov or .mil addresses at this time. Please contact your O365 admin. |
| **Self-service signup disabled** You receive a message like the following during signup: <br /><br /> *We can't finish signing you up. Your IT department has turned off signup for Microsoft Power BI. Contact them to complete signup.* <br /><br /> or <br /><br /> *That looks like a personal email address. Enter your work address so we can connect you with others in your company. And don’t worry. We won’t share your address with anyone.* | Your organization’s IT administrator has disabled self-service signup for Power BI. <br /><br /> To complete signup, contact your IT administrator and ask them to follow the instructions on the page below to allow existing users to sign up for Power BI and to allow new users to join your existing tenant. <br/><br/> You may also experience this problem if you signed up for Office 365 through a partner.
