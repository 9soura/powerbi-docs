Power BI can be your personal report and visualization tool, and can also serve as the analytics and decision engine behind group projects, divisions, or entire corporations.

This article will walk you through your options on how to sign up and begin using the Power BI service.

## You have a few options

As an individual you have several options to sign up and begin using Power BI. You can choose to sign up for free or you can purchase a Power BI Pro subscription. If you sign up for a free account, once you are in the service, you can opt into a free 60 day trial of Power BI Pro.

If you are part of an existing organization, that uses Office 365, you can still sign up for a free account. Your IT Admin also has some options to purchase Power BI Pro and assign licenses. For more information about what options are available as an IT Admin, see [Purchasing Power BI Pro](powerbi-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro.md).

> [AZURE.NOTE] If you are in an organization, individual sign up may be disabled. See [Individual Sign up has been turned off](#individual-sign-up-has-been-turned-off) for more information if you get an error indicating it has been turned off.

    Your IT department has turned off signup for Microsoft Power BI.
 
![](media/powerbi-service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi/allowadhocsubscriptionfalse.png)
