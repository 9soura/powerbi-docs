# Delete or remove a dashboard  

Dashboards can be deleted and removed.  Deleting and removing the dashboard does not delete the underlying dataset or any reports associated with that dashboard.

-   If you are the owner of the dashboard, you can delete it. If you've shared the dashboard with colleagues, deleting does not remove the dashboard from their Power BI workspace.

-   If a dashboard is shared with you and you no longer want to see it, you can remove it.  Removing a dashboard does not remove it from anyone else's Power BI workspace.

-   If a dashboard is part of an [organizational content pack](powerbi-service-organizational-content-pack-delete.md), the only way to delete it is to delete the associated dataset.

## To delete a dashboard  
1.  In the navigation pane, right-click the dashboard to delete.

2.  Click **Delete**.  Deleting the dashboard does not delete the underlying dataset or any reports associated with that dashboard.

>**Note:**  
>Dashboards that are part of an organizational content packs have a different process for deleting.  See [Delete an organizational content pack](powerbi-service-organizational-content-pack-delete.md).

## To remove a shared dashboard  
A sharing icon ![](media/powerbi-service-delete-or-remove-a-dashboard/PBI_SharedWithYouIcon.png) tells you that the dashboard is being [shared](powerbi-service-share-unshare-dashboard.md)with you.  Shared dashboards are read-only and can't be deleted -- only removed. To remove a dashboard, follow the same steps as deleting, but select **Remove**.
