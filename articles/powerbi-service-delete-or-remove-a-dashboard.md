#Delete or remove a dashboard

[← All about dashboards](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/topics/65158-all-about-dashboards)

Dashboards can be deleted and removed.  Deleting and removing the dashboard does not delete the underlying dataset or any reports associated with that dashboard.

-   If you are the owner of the dashboard, you can delete it. If you've shared the dashboard with coworkers, deleting does not remove the dashboard from their Power BI.
-   If a dashboard is shared with you and you no longer want to see it, you can remove it.  Removing a dashboard does not remove it from anyone else's Power BI.
    

##To delete a dashboard

1.  In the navigation pane, right-click the dashboard to delete.

2.  Click **Delete**.  Deleting the dashboard does not delete the underlying dataset or any reports associated with that dashboard.

##To remove a dashboard

A lock icon ![](media/powerbi-service-delete-or-remove-a-dashboard/pbi_Nancy_lock.png) tells you that the dashboard is being [shared](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/431008-share-a-dashboard)with you.  Shared dashboards are read-only and can't be deleted -- only removed. To remove a dashboard, follow the same steps as deleting, but click **Remove**.
