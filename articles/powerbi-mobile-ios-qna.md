# Ask questions about your data with Q&A in the iOS mobile apps

The easiest way to learn about your data in to ask questions about it in your own words. You can already do that in the Power BI service at [https://powerbi.com](http://powerbi.com) by typing a question in the box at the top of a dashboard. Now you can do the same in the Microsoft Power BI app for iOS on iPads, iPhones, and iPod Touch devices.

* Or click this link to [add the sample to your workspace](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/getdata/samples/retail-analysis-sample). If you don't have an account or you're not signed in, follow the prompts.
