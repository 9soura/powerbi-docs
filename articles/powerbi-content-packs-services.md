# Connect to services with Power BI

You can connect to a number of services you use to run your business, such as Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, and Google Analytics. Power BI starts by using your credentials to connect to the service, and then creates a Power BI app with a dashboard and a set of Power BI reports that automatically show your data and provide visual insights about your business. 

Log in to Power BI to view all of the [services you can connect to](https://app.powerbi.com/getdata/services). The Power BI team adds new services regularly.

## What's included

After connecting to a service, you see a newly created app with a dashboard, reports, and dataset. The apps include content from the service focused on a specific scenario and do not include all the information from the service. The data is scheduled to refresh automatically once per day. You can control the schedule by selecting the dataset.

You can also use [Power BI Desktop](powerbi-desktop-get-the-desktop.md) to connect to some services, such as Google Analytics, and create your own customized dashboards and reports.  

For more details on connecting to a specific service, please refer to its individual help page.

## Get started

[AZURE.INCLUDE [powerbi-service-apps-get-more-apps](../includes/powerbi-service-apps-get-more-apps.md)]

3.  Browse the content packs, or tap in the search box and type keywords:  

    ![](media/powerbi-content-packs-services/search.png)

After you connect to a service, go to **Apps** in the left navigation pane to see the dashboard created with your own data. You can ask a question by typing in the Q&A box, or click a tile to open the underlying report.

## Troubleshooting

**Empty tiles**  
While Power BI is first connecting to the service, you will see an empty set of tiles on your dashboard. If you still see an empty dashboard after 2 hours, it's likely the connection failed. If you didn't see an error message with information on correcting the issue, please file a support ticket.

- Select the question mark icon (**?**) in the upper-right corner >  **Get help**.

**Missing information**  
The content packs include content from the service focused on a specific scenario and do not include all the information from the service. If there's a specific metric that you're not seeing in the content pack, please add an idea on the [Power BI Support](https://support.powerbi.com/forums/265200-power-bi) page.
