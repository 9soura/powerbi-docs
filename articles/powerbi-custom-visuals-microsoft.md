# Enhanced Scatter

Enhanced Scatter chart is useful for finding correlations and non-linear relationships between variables.It builds on top of the existing scatter chart and provides advanced options such as displaying shapes or images instead of the standard bubbles.This also includes background image support

For  Shape, Image, and Backdrop values, you must use a measure that returns a text value. If you have a column containing the shape name or image URLs, then you need to create a measure to return the first non-blank row (or any other logic that would return one text value and use that in this field bucket).

For Shape the allowed values are circle, cross, diamond, square, triangle-up, triangle-down, star, hexagon, x, up arrow, and down arrow.For Image and Backdrop, provide a URL that points to an image file.

Use Backdrop to display an image as the background for the chart. If you are using the Backdrop, then the xmin, xmax , ymin and ymax fields allow you to align your background image with the x andy coordinates used to plot the data.
