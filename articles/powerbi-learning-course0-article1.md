# An Introduction to Power BI

[![Welcome to Power BI](http://img.youtube.com/vi/1c01r_pAZdk/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c01r_pAZdk)

*Get an overview of what Power BI is and what it can do for your organization*

Power BI is suite of business analytics tools that connects and combines your various data, provides tools to analyze and model that data, and then tracks changes to give you insights into your business or organization. Power BI has a number of different components, namely Power BI Desktop, the Power BI service, and Power BI Mobile.

The **Power BI Desktop** gives you tools to shape and model your data. You can add your own calculations and even R formulas to transform and find new insights, and use out-of-the-box visualization tools to build reports directly on top of your model. The **Power BI service** is where you can publish your reports and visualizations, and build dashboards that aggregate data from many different sources, including on-premises data and third party connectors from cloud services such as Google Analytics. The **Power BI Mobile** applications provide a way to track your critical dashboards and KPIs while on the go.

With Power BI, you can easily share and collaborate with the rest of your organization and ask questions of your data in natural language. Developers can use the API to programmatically access Power BI's tools to create custom visualizations that can be shared and used by others.
