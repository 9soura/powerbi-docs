# Create a content pack in Power BI

In this lesson, we create a *content pack* with existing artifacts we already have in Power BI, and then share those with colleagues.

Here in My Workspace, I have a dashboard, and the report underneath, and the dataset. I want to package them all up and share them with people in my organization so they can reuse them.

Here under the settings icon, I can see how much storage I've used, and I can create a content pack.

Here I can choose whether to distribute it to specific people or groups. I give it a title. It's a good idea to give it a detailed description, to help when people are browsing for a content pack.

I upload an image, and now the important part: I select a dashboard, and Power BI automatically selects the report and dataset that are used in the dashboard. I can't unselect the report and dataset because the dashboard needs them.

I could select other dashboards, reports, and datasets, but I won't now. 

When I publish, the content pack is sent up to the organization's content gallery.
