# Create Content Packs

*Watch and learn how to publish a content pack with a bundle of existing dashboards, reports, and datasets*

You can create content packs using existing artifacts in Power BI, such as dashboards, reports, and datasets.

To create a content pack, first log in to the Power BI service. Select the **Settings icon** in the top right-hand corner of the screen, and choose **Create content pack** from the menu. This will open the Create Content Pack settings page.

From here you can specify who will have access to your content pack (specific groups or everyone in your organization), name your pack, and add a helpful description and image. Finally, use the checkboxes to indicate which dashboards, reports, and datasets you would like to publish as part of your pack. Items dependencies, such as the datasets behind a dashboard, are automatically grouped. When you are finished, select **Publish**.

Your content pack will be published to your organization's content gallery.
