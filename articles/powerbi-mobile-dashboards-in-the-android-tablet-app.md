# Dashboards in the Power BI app for Android tablets  

Dashboards are a portal to your company's life cycle. Learn how you can view, explore, and share your dashboards in the Android tablet app for Power BI.

You don't create dashboards on your Android tablet. You [create dashboards](powerbi-service-dashboards.md) or [connect to built-in dashboards for services](powerbi-content-packs-services.md) such as Salesforce in the Power BI service ([https://www.powerbi.com](https://www.powerbi.com)) on your computer.

Then in the [Android app for Microsoft Power BI](powerbi-mobile-android-tablet-app-get-started.md), you can explore these same dashboards. Dashboards refresh in real time, automatically, so you don't need to manually refresh them.

## View dashboards on your Android tablet  
1.  Open the Power BI app on your Android tablet and sign in.

3.  Tap a dashboard to open it.

     -     The yellow stars ![](media/powerbi-mobile-dashboards-in-the-android-tablet-app/power-bi-mobile-yes-favorite-icon.png) show which dashboards are favorites. 

     -     The notation below each dashboard name ![](media/powerbi-mobile-dashboards-in-the-android-tablet-app/power-bi-android-dashboard-medium-classification.png) shows how the data in each dashboard is classified. Read more about [data classification in Power BI](powerbi-service-data-classification.md).


5.  While on the dashboard, you can tap the vertical ellipsis (...) next to the name to invite a colleague, refresh, or get information about the dashboard:
