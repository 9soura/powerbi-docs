# Get More Space on Your Dashboard

*See how to manage your dashboard space more effectively with Full Screen Mode*

You may find that occasionally when you create your dashboards, you have a lot of content to fit on a small canvas. There are a few different ways that you manage your dashboard space to reduce this problem.

The easiest method is selecting the **Enter Full Screen Mode** button in the top right-hand corner of the dashboard. This puts your browser into full screen mode, increasing the amount of viewable space. From within Full-Screen Mode, select the **Fit to Screen** option to shrink all of your tiles so they fit on a single screen without the need for scrollbars. This is commonly called TV mode, and is useful for giving presentations with dashboards.

Another way to manage dashboard space is collapsing the navigation bar on the left-hand side of the page by selecting the hamburger icon. You ensure that a dashboard will always have a collapsed navigation bar by appending "?collapseNavigation=true" to the end of its URL. Using that link will open the dashboard with a minimized navigation bar.
