# Display a dashboard tile or report visual in Focus mode

## What is Focus mode?  

***Focus*** mode lets you expand (pop out) a dashboard tile or report visual to see more detail.  While in Focus mode for a dashboard tile, you can view and modify the filters that were applied when this visual was created.  And while in Focus mode for a report visual, you can view and modify the Visual level and Page level filters.

>**NOTE**: Currently, Focus mode is not available for tiles created from Q&A or for map tiles. 

>**NOTE**:
>Focus is different from Full Screen mode.  Full Screen mode is available for [dashboards and reports ](powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen.md) and [tiles](powerbi-service-display-tile-in-full-screen-mode.md).

1.  Hover over the tile or visual and select the **Focus mode** icon ![](media/powerbi-service-display-tile-in-full-screen-mode/PBI_popOut.jpg).

4.  Explore further by modifying the filters and, if you discover something interesting, pin the visual to a dashboard.   

6.  Leave Focus mode and return to the dashboard by selecting the Focus mode icon (in the top left corner of the visual).

## Go from Focus mode to Full Screen mode
Once in Focus mode, the tile or visual can then be [viewed in full screen (TV Mode.)](powerbi-service-display-tile-in-full-screen-mode.md) Full Screen Mode displays without the distraction of menus and navigation buttons.
