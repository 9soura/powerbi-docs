# Get started with Power BI

##  Getting Started

This tutorial helps you get started with Power BI service.  If you're looking for help with Power BI Desktop, see [Get started with Desktop](powerbi-desktop-getting-started.md).

Microsoft Power BI helps you stay up to date with the information that matters to you.  With Power BI, ***dashboards*** help you keep a finger on the pulse of your business.  Your dashboards display ***tiles*** that you can click to open ***reports*** for exploring further.  Connect to multiple ***datasets*** to bring all of the relevant data together in one place.

Need help understanding the building blocks that make up Power BI?  See [Power BI - Basic Concepts](powerbi-service-basic-concepts.md).

If you have important data in Excel or CSV files, you can create a Power BI dashboard to stay informed anywhere and share insights with others.  Do you have a subscription to a SaaS application like Salesforce?  Get a head start by [connecting to Salesforce](powerbi-content-pack-salesforce.md) to automatically create a dashboard from that data, or [check out all the other SaaS apps](powerbi-service-get-data.md) you can connect to. If you are part of an organization, see if any [organizational content packs](powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-introduction.md) have been published for you.


Read about all the other ways to [get data for Power BI](powerbi-service-get-data.md).

## Step 1: Get data

Here's an example of getting data from a CSV file. Want to follow along with this tutorial? [Download this sample CSV file](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=619356).

1.  [Sign in to Power BI](http://www.powerbi.com/). Don’t have an account? You can sign up for [Power BI for free](http://www.powerbi.com/ "try out the new Power BI Preview for free").

1.  If you're in your workspace, select **Get Data** at the bottom of the left navigation pane.

    ![](media/powerbi-service-get-started/getdata3.png)

2.  Select **Files**. 

    ![](media/powerbi-service-get-started/gs1.png)

3.  Select **Local File**, browse to the file on your computer, and choose **Open**.

    ![](media/powerbi-service-get-started/gs2.png)

4.  Power BI uploads the CSV file and adds it as a new dataset (the yellow asterisk indicates a new item).  Since we did not already have a dashboard, Power BI also created a new dashboard for us.  In the left navigation pane, the new dashboard is listed under the **Dashboards** heading, and the new dataset appears under the **Datasets** heading. 

    ![](media/powerbi-service-get-started/gs4.png)


## Step 2: Start exploring your dataset

Now that you have connected to data, explore to find insights.  When you've found something you want to monitor, you can create a dashboard to keep up-to-date with changes.

1.  Select the dataset image on the dashboard to explore the data you just connected to or, under the **Datasets** heading,click the dataset name to open it.

    ![](media/powerbi-service-get-started/gettingstart4.png)

    >NOTE: Another way to explore your data is **Quick Insights**.  For more information, see [Introduction to Quick Insights](powerbi-service-auto-insights.md)

2.  In the **Fields** list on the right side of the page, select fields to build a visualization.  Select the checkbox beside **﻿Gross Sales**﻿ and  **﻿Date**﻿.

    ![](media/powerbi-service-get-started/fields.png)

3.  Power BI analyzes the data and creates a visual.  If you selected **Date** first, you'll see a table.  If you selected **Gross Sales** first, you'll see a chart. Switch to a different way of displaying your data. Try changing to a line chart by selecting the line chart option.

    ![](media/powerbi-service-get-started/gettingstart5new.png)

4.  When you have a visualization you want on your dashboard, hover over the visualization and select the **﻿Pin**﻿ icon.  When you pin this visualization, it will be stored on your dashboard so you can track the latest value at a glance.

    ![](media/powerbi-service-get-started/pinnew.png)

5.  Because this is a new report, you need to save it before you can pin a visualization from it to the dashboard. Give your report a name (e.g., *Sales Over Time*) and select **Save and Continue**. 

    ![](media/powerbi-service-get-started/PBI_GetStartSaveB4Pinnew.png)

    The new report appears in the navigation pane under the **Reports** heading.

6.  Pin the tile to an existing dashboard or to a new dashboard. 

    ![](media/powerbi-service-get-started/PBI_GS_PinDialognew.png)

    -   **Existing dashboard**: select the name of the dashboard from the dropdown.
    -   **New dashboard**: type the name of the new dashboard.

7.  Select **Pin**.

    A Success message (near the top right corner) lets you know the visualization was added, as a tile, to your dashboard.

    ![](media/powerbi-service-get-started/pinSuccess.png)

8.  Back on your dashboard, you can see your new visualization. Make your dashboard even better by [renaming, resizing, linking, and repositioning tiles](powerbi-service-edit-a-tile-in-a-dashboard.md).﻿﻿

    ![](media/powerbi-service-get-started/gsPinFirstnew.png)

    Select the new tile on your dashboard to return to the report any time.

##  Step 3: Continue exploring with Q&A (natural language querying)

1.  For a quick exploration of your data, try asking a question in the Q&A box. The Q&A question box is located at the top of your dashboard. For example, try typing "**what segment had the most revenue**".

    ![](media/powerbi-service-get-started/powerbi-qna.png)

1. Select the pin icon ![](media/powerbi-service-get-started/PBI_PinIcon.png) to show this visualization on your dashboard too.

2. Pin the visualization to the Financial Sample dashboard.

3. Select the back arrow ![](media/powerbi-service-get-started/PBI_QABackArrow.png) to return to your dashboard where you'll see the new tile.
