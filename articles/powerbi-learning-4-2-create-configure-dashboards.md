# Start and Configure A Dashboard

*Discover how to configure and customize your Power BI service dashboards*

The building blocks for dashboards are your own reports that you authored and published using Power BI Desktop. You add visualizations, including graphs, maps, images, and shapes, to your dashboard by "Pinning" them. A pinned visual is known as a dashboard "tile".

To pin a visual, first open its report on the Power BI service. Hover over the visual you want to pin, and select the pin icon. You can select a destination dashboard from the drop-down menu, or create a new one. You can pin visualizations from multiple reports and pages to a single dashboard, allowing you to combine different datasets and sources into a single point of insight.

Your dashboards, including any new ones, will appear in the list on the left-hand side of the screen. Select a dashboard from the list to view it. To resize a tile, click on it and drag its handles in or out. To move a tile, simply click and drag it to a different location on the dashboard. Hover over a tile and click the pencil icon to open the Tile Details, where you can change the Title or Subtitle.

Click on a dashboard tile to view the report from which it originated. This allows a dashboard user to quickly view the underlying data beneath a visual, or you can change the link by using the Set custom link field in Tile Details.

You can pin tiles from one dashboard to another, for example if you have a collection of dashboards and want to create one summary board. The process is the same as with reports: hover over the tile and select the the pin icon.
