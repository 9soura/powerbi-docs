   # Integrate a Power BI tile or report into an app

   To quickly get started integrating a Power BI **tile** or **report** into an app, download the [Integrate Power BI tiles sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-CSharp/tree/master/samples/webforms/embed-a-tile-into-an-app) or [Integrate Power BI reports sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-CSharp/tree/master/samples/webforms/embed-a-report-into-an-app) on GitHub.

   With Power BI, you can enable application developers to integrate Power BI **tiles** and **reports** from a user's power BI account by embedding an **IFrame** into an app, such as a mobile app or web app. The PowerBI.com service allows business users to build, and personalize chart tiles, reports, and dashboards in their own Power BI account. The embed a **tile** or **report** capability enables you to integrate those tiles or reports into an app. Here are some of the benefits of integrating Power BI tiles or reports into an app:

   -	Provide user customizable data tiles or reports in an app for a small investment.
   -	Users can integrate data from any data source outside the application to enhance contextual understanding.
   -	Users can click an embedded Power BI tile to navigate to the Power BI **dashboard**.
