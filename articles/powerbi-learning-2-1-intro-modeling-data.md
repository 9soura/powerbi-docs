# Introduction to Modeling Your Data

Now that we've reviewed how to import your data and transform it, it's time to start modeling.

One of Power BI's strengths is that you don't need to flatten your data into one table. Instead, you can use multiple tables from multiple sources, and define the **relationship** between them. You can also create your own custom calculations and assign new metrics to view specific segments of your data, and use these new measures in visualizations for easy modeling.
