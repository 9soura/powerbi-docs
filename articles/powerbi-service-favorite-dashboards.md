# Favorite dashboards in the Power BI service

When you make a dashboard or app a *favorite*,  you'll be able to access it from all of your workspaces.  Favorites are typically those that you visit most often.

>[AZURE.NOTE] This topic applies to Power BI service, and not to Power BI Desktop.

You can also select a single dashboard as a [Featured dashboard](powerbi-service-featured-dashboards.md) in Power BI.

## Add a dashboard as a *favorite*

1.  Open a dashboard that you use often. Even dashboards that have been shared with you can be a *favorite*.

2.  From the top-right corner of Power BI service, select **Favorite** or the star ![](media/powerbi-service-favorite-dashboards/power-bi-favorite-icon.png)  icon.

    You can also favorite a dashboard from your workspace **Dashboards** tab.

##    Working with *favorites*

1.    To see your five most-recent favorites, from any workspace, select the arrow to the right of **Favorites**.  From here you can select a favorite dashboard or app to open it. Only the most-recent five favorites are listed (alphabetically). If you have more than five favorites, select **See all** to open the Favorites screen (see #2, below).

2. To see **all** the dashboards and apps that you have added as favorites, in the left navpane, select **Favorites** or the Favorites ![](media/powerbi-service-favorite-dashboards/power-bi-favorites-icon.png)  icon.  

    ![](media/powerbi-service-favorite-dashboards/power-bi-favorites-screen.png)

   From here you can select a dashboard to open it, or share a dashboard with colleagues.

## Unfavorite a dashboard or app

No longer use a dashboard or app as often as you used to?  You can unfavorite it. When you unfavorite a dashboard or app, it is removed from your Favorites but not from Power BI.


1.  In the left navigation pane, select **Favorites** to open the **Favorites** screen.

2. Select the yellow star next to the dashboard or app to unfavorite.

>**NOTE**: You can also unfavorite a dashboard from the dashboard itself. In the top-right corner of the dashboard you'll see a yellow star and the word **Unfavorite**. Select either to remove that dashboard from your favorites list.
