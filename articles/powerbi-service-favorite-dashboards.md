# Favorite dashboards in the Power BI service

When you make a dashboard a *favorite*,  you'll be able to access it from all of your workspaces.  Favorite dashboards are typically those that you visit most often.

>[AZURE.NOTE] This topic applies to Power BI service, and not to Power BI Desktop.

You can also select a single dashboard as a [Featured dashboard](powerbi-service-featured-dashboards.md) in Power BI.

## Add dashboards as "favorites"

1.  In the left navigation pane, select a dashboard.

2.  From the top-right corner of Power BI service, select **Favorite**.

3. To see all the dashboards that you have added as favorites, in the left navpane, select **Favorites**.

  From here you can select a dashboard to open it, or share a dashboard with colleagues.

## Unfavorite a dashboard

No longer use a dashboard as much as you used to?  You can unfavorite it.

1.  In the left navigation pane, select the dashboard.

2.  From the top-right corner, select **Unfavorite**.  The dashboard is removed from your Favorites but not from your Power BI.
