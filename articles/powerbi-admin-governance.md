# Power BI Governance and Deployment Approaches

Over the last few decades companies have become increasingly aware of the need to strategically leverage data assets to profit from market opportunities. Either by performing competitive analysis or by understanding operational patterns, many organizations now understand they can benefit from having a data strategy as a way to stay ahead of their competition.  
 
This whitepaper provides a framework for increasing the return on investment related to Power BI as companies seek to increasingly become more data-savvy.

Business Intelligence practitioners typically define data-savvy companies as those that benefit from the use of factual information to support decision making.  We even describe certain organizations as having a “data culture.”
Whether at the organizational level, or at a departmental level, a data culture can positively alter a company’s ability to adapt and thrive.  Data insights must not always be of enterprise scope to be far-reaching: small operational insights that can alter day-to-day operations can be transformational as well.

For these companies, there is an understanding that facts – and fact analysis – must drive how business processes are defined. Team members attempt to seek data, identify patterns, and share findings with others. 

This approach can be useful regardless of if the analysis is done over external or internal business factors. It is first and foremost a perspective, not a process.
