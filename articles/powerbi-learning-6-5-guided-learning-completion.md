# Congratulations - and what's next for you

You did it! **Congratulations!** You've completed the **Guided Learning** course for Power BI. You've come full circle from learning the basic elements of Power BI, taken a tour through its software features and elements, and learned how they all work together.

This is the last section (and the final topic) in the course, so if you went through all of these sections in order, take a moment to pat yourself on the back. Good job! You're now well versed in all these **important concepts**:

-   What [Power BI is](powerbi-learning-0-0-what-is-power-bi.md)
-   The [building blocks](powerbi-learning-0b-building-blocks-power-bi.md) of Power BI
-   [Getting](powerbi-learning-1-2-connect-to-data-sources-in-power-bi-desktop.md) and [modeling](powerbi-learning-2-1-intro-modeling-data.md) data
-   [Visualizations](powerbi-learning-3-1-intro-visualizations.md)
-   [Exploring data](powerbi-learning-4-0-intro-power-bi-service.md) in the Power BI service
-   Using [Excel and Power BI](powerbi-learning-5-1-intro-excel-data.md) together
-   And [publishing and sharing](powerbi-learning-6-0-intro-content-packs-groups.md) your work

That's a lot of knowledge, and now that you have all this in your head, you're ready to go put it to use! Here are some **links to downloads** or to get your browser **connected to the Power BI service**:
