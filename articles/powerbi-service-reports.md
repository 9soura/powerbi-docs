# Reports in Power BI

Dashboards, reports, and datasets are at the heart of Power BI. A **report** is a multi-perspective view into your data, with visualizations that represent different findings and insights from that data.  A report may have a single visualization or pages full of visualizations.

Need help understanding the building blocks that make up Power BI?  See [Power BI - Basic Concepts](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/487029-power-bi-preview-basic-concepts).

You can [create a report from scratch](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/475616-create-a-new-power-bi-report) or [have one shared with you](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/431008-share-a-dashboard). And for some kinds of data, Power BI will [create a report for you as it adds the dataset](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/434354-get-data).  

## For more information about reports:

[**Creating a report**](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/475616-create-a-new-power-bi-report)**  **requires a [dataset](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/434354-get-data).  

View and interact with reports in either [**Reading View**](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/445094-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view)or **[Editing View](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/443094-edit-a-report)**. Editing View is only available to a report creator and has many more options for creating and modifying reports.

Did you participate in the Power BI Preview?  [Find out how to upgrade to the new report canvas](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/663517).

[The report editor... take a tour](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/665494) - including the Visualizations pane, Filters pane, and Fields pane.

**[Filter and highlight data in reports](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/467092-about-filters-and-highlighting-in-reports)** -- create them in [Editing View](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/443094-edit-a-report) and interact with them in [Reading View.](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/445094-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view)

[**Add a page to a report**](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/474804-add-a-page-to-a-power-bi-report) if you need more room.

[Reorder report pages](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/475186) to put the most-important information first.

[**Delete a page from a report**](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/474805-delete-a-page-from-a-power-bi-report), even if it's not blank.

**[Renaming a report ](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/474347-rename-a-report)**  doesn't change the name of any associated dashboard or dataset.

[**Save a report**](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/444112-save-a-report) so you can use it again and share it with colleagues. The name of the saved report is added to your Power BI navigation pane, under the **Reports** heading.

**[Delete a report](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/474346-delete-a-report)** if you don't need it any more. Deleting the report does not remove the dataset.

## View reports in the navigation pane

Power BI can have more than one report-- as you add reports, their titles are added to the list under the **Reports** heading (see screenshot below). The report you're currently viewing is highlighted. New reports have a yellow asterisk. Only one report can be open at a time.
