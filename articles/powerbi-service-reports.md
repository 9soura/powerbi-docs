# Reports in Power BI

Dashboards, reports, and datasets are at the heart of Power BI. A **report** is a multi-perspective view into your data, with visualizations that represent different findings and insights from that data.  A report may have a single visualization or pages full of visualizations.

Need help understanding the building blocks that make up Power BI?  See [Power BI - Basic Concepts](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/487029).

You can [create a report from scratch](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/475616) or [have one shared with you](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/431008). And for some kinds of data, Power BI will [create a report for you as it adds the dataset](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/434354).  

## For more information about reports:

[**Creating a report**](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/475616)**  **requires a [dataset](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/434354).  

View and interact with reports in either [**Reading View**](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/445094)or **[Editing View](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/443094)**. Editing View is only available to a report creator and has many more options for creating and modifying reports.

Did you participate in the Power BI Preview?  [Find out how to upgrade to the new report canvas](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/663517).

[The report editor... take a tour](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/665494) - including the Visualizations pane, Filters pane, and Fields pane.

**[Filter and highlight data in reports](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/467092)** -- create them in [Editing View](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/443094) and interact with them in [Reading View.](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/445094)

[**Add a page to a report**](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/474804) if you need more room.

[Reorder report pages](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/475186) to put the most-important information first.

[**Delete a page from a report**](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/474805), even if it's not blank.

**[Renaming a report ](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/474347)**  doesn't change the name of any associated dashboard or dataset.

[**Save a report**](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/444112) so you can use it again and share it with colleagues. The name of the saved report is added to your Power BI navigation pane, under the **Reports** heading.

**[Delete a report](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/474346)** if you don't need it any more. Deleting the report does not remove the dataset.

## View reports in the navigation pane

Power BI can have more than one report-- as you add reports, their titles are added to the list under the **Reports** heading (see screenshot below). The report you're currently viewing is highlighted. New reports have a yellow asterisk. Only one report can be open at a time.
