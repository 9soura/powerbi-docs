# Connect to Data Sources in Power BI Desktop

[![Connect to Data Sources](./media/powerbi-learning-course1-article2/videothumb.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6s0osmRCZ4)

*See how to connect Power BI Desktop to almost any data source*

Power BI Desktop can connect to a whole range of data sources, including on-premises databases, Excel workbooks, and cloud services. Currently, over 59 different cloud services such as GitHub and Marketo have specific connectors, and you can connect to generic sources through XML, CSV, text, and ODBC. Power BI will even scrape tabular data directly from a website URL!

To connect to your data source, start by selecting **Get Data**. You'll be shown a list of all possible sources. Click on a source to select it and establish a connection. Depending on your selection, you will be asked to find the source on your computer or network, or be prompted to log in to a service to authenticate your request.

After connecting, the first window you'll see is the Navigator. It displays the tables or entities of your data source, and clicking on one gives you a preview of its contents. You can then import your selected tables or entities immediately, or select **Edit** to transform and clean your data before importing.
