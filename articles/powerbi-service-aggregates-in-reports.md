# Aggregates in Power BI reports

## ∑ Aggregates

A measure is a numeric value that will be aggregated in some way (summed or averaged, for example). Measures are imported with the data (defined in the data model your report is based on).

### Change how a measure is aggregated in a chart

Say you have a chart that sums the sales data for different regions, but you'd rather have the average. 

1.  Add the measure (numeric field) to a visualization.

2.  Find that field in the **Fields** pane bucket, right-click, and select the aggregate type you need.

### Convert a non-aggregate field to an aggregate

You can also use a non-aggregate field as an aggregate. For example, if you have a Product Name field, you can add it to a table and then set it to Count. 

For more information on aggregating values see [Change The Aggregation Used In a Visual](https://powerbi.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/471200-change-the-aggregation-used-in-a-chart-sum-avera).
