# Guided Learning for Power BI

Welcome to the **Guided Learning** collection of courses for Power BI, where you’ll learn how you can use Power BI to connect to data, analyze that data, and uncover insights that help you make better business decisions.

This course helps you understand Power BI, and shows you how to use its capabilities and features to unlock powerful insights on your own data.

After the first couple of topics in this **Getting Started** section, nearly every **topic** in this course includes a video that provides an overview of what you’ll learn in that topic. Then the content below the video further explains that content, and lets you absorb the information at your own pace.

We start with the basics, and then move through topics and features in Power BI in a logical sequence. We hope you enjoy the course, and look forward to including more content in the future.

## What is Power BI?
**Power BI** is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Whether your data is a simple Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses, **Power BI** lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize (or discover) what’s important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.

**Power BI** can be simple and fast – capable of creating quick insights from an Excel spreadsheet or a local database. But **Power BI** is also robust and enterprise-grade, ready for extensive modeling and real-time analytics, as well as custom development. So it can be your personal report and visualization tool, and can also serve as the analytics and decision engine behind group projects, divisions, or entire corporations.

## The Parts of Power BI
Power BI consists of a Windows desktop application called **Power BI Desktop**, an online SaaS (*Software as a Service*) service called **Power BI service**, and mobile Power BI apps available on Windows phones and tablets, as well as for iOS and Android devices.

These three elements – the **Desktop**, the **service**, and **Mobile** – are designed to let people create, share, or consume business insights in the way that serves them, or their role, most effectively.

For example, you might primarily use the **Power BI service**, but your number-crunching, business-report-creating coworker might make extensive use of **Power BI Desktop** (and publish Desktop reports to the Power BI service, which you then view). And another coworker, in sales, might mainly use her Power BI phone app to monitor progress on her sales quotas, and to drill into new sales lead details.

You also might use each element of **Power BI** at different times, depending on what you’re trying to achieve, or what your role is for a given project or effort. Perhaps you view inventory and manufacturing progress in a real-time dashboard in the service, and also use **Power BI Desktop** to create reports for your own team about customer engagement statistics. How you use Power BI can be based on which feature or service of Power BI is the best tool for your situation – but each part of Power BI is available to you, which is why it’s so flexible and compelling.

We discuss these three elements – the **Desktop**, **service**, and **Mobile** apps – with more detail a little later in this Guided Learning course. We’ll also create reports in the Desktop, share them in the service, and drill into them on our Mobile device in upcoming articles, too.

## The Flow of Work in Power BI
A common flow of work in Power BI begins in Power BI Desktop, where a report is created. That report is then shared to the Power BI service, and then shared so users of Power BI Mobile can consume the information. It doesn’t always happen that way, and that’s okay, but we’ll use that flow to help you learn the various parts of Power BI, and how they complement one another.
