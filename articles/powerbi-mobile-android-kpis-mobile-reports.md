The Android app for Power BI offers live, touch-enabled mobile access to your important on-premises business information.

First things first:

-  You [create Reporting Services mobile reports](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652547.aspx) with SQL Server 2016 Enterprise Edition Mobile Report Publisher and publish them to the [Reporting Services web portal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt637133.aspx). You can even [create a special mobile report layout for phones](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt703702.aspx). 
-   You can also create KPIs right in the web portal, and organize them all in folders and mark your favorites, so you can find them easily. 

Then in the Android app for Power BI, view the mobile reports and KPIs, organized in folders or collected as favorites. 

## Explore samples without an SSRS server

Even if you don't have access to a Reporting Services web portal, you can still explore the features of Reporting Services mobile reports. 

-  Tap the options icon ![](media/powerbi-mobile-android-kpis-mobile-reports/pbi_and_menuiconbordr.png) in the upper-left corner, scroll down and tap SQL Server RS Samples.

Browse the samples to interact with KPIs and mobile reports.

## Connect to a server to view Reporting Services mobile reports 

1.  In your Android phone, open the Power BI app.
  
3. Tap the options icon ![](media/powerbi-mobile-android-kpis-mobile-reports/pbi_and_menuiconbordr.png) in the upper-left corner, and tap **Connect to SSRS server**.

4. Fill in the server address and your user name and password. Use a fully qualified domain name for both the server and your user name,  in this format:

     `http://<servername>.<domainname>/reports`

     Or

     `https://<servername>.<domainname>/reports`
     
     >**Note**: Include **http** or **https** in front of the connection string.

    Tap **Advanced option** to give the server a name, if you'd like.

3. Tap the check mark in the upper-right corner.

5.  Now you see the server in the left navigation bar.

## Remove a connection to a report server

You can only be connected to one report server at a time from your Android app. If you want to connect to a different server, you need to disconnect from the current one.

1. At the bottom of the left navigation bar, tap **Settings**.
2. Tap the ellipsis (**...**) next to the server name you don't want to be connected to.
3. Tap **Remove Connection**.


## Create Reporting Services mobile reports and KPIs

You don't create Reporting Services KPIs and mobile reports in the Power BI mobile app. You create them in SQL Server 2016 Enterprise Edition Mobile Report Publisher and a SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services web portal.

- [Create your own Reporting Services mobile reports](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652547.aspx) and publish them to the Reporting Services web portal.
- [Create a special mobile report layout for phones](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt703702.aspx).
- Create [KPIs on the Reporting Services web portal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt683632.aspx)
