The Android app for Power BI offers live, touch-enabled mobile access to your important on-premises business information. 

![](media/powerbi-mobile-android-kpis-mobile-reports/pbi_ssrs_and_foldrs.png)

[Create SQL Server mobile reports](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652547.aspx) with the SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher and publish them to the [Reporting Services web portal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt637133.aspx). Create KPIs right in the web portal. Organize them in folders and mark your favorites, so you can find them easily. 

Then in the Android app for Power BI, view the mobile reports and KPIs, organized in folders or collected as favorites.
