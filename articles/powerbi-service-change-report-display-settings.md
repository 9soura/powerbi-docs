# Page display settings in a Power BI report

We understand it is critical to keep your report layout pixel perfect. Sometimes, it can be challenging, because you and your colleagues view those reports on screens with different aspect ratios and sizes. 

The default display view is **Fit to page** and the default display size is **16:9**. If you want to lock in a different aspect ratio, or want to fit your report in a different way, there are two tools to help you: ***Page View*** settings and ***Page Size*** settings.

>**NOTE**: Selecting the default setting in one, resets the other to its default as well.

## When to use Dynamic view

-   some devices use 4:3 and some use 16:9 ratios and the report owner wants everyone, regardless of device, to see the same thing.
-   reports that will be embedded in other applications must display well using the application's display space and aspect ratio. 
-   Dynamic view sometimes truncates cards and text which may make the report look unprofessional.

## Page View settings

The *Page View* settings let you control the display of your report page relative to the browser window.  You can choose between:

-   **Dynamic:** contents adjust to fit the available space and the labels and text stay the same size.
-   **Fit to Page** (default): contents are scaled to best fit the page
-   **Fit to Width**: contents are scaled to fit within the width of the page
-   **Actual Size**: contents are displayed at full size

Page View settings are available in both [Reading View](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view.md) and [Editing View](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md). In Editing View, a report owner can assign a Page View setting to individual report pages, and those settings are saved with the report. When a colleague opens that report in Reading View, she sees the report pages display using the owner's settings.  However, while working with the report in Reading View, she can temporarily change the Page View settings.  Once she leaves the report, the Page View settings revert back to those that were set by the report owner.

## Page Size settings

The *Page Size* settings control the display ratio and actual size (in pixels).  Page Size settings are only available in Editing View.

-   4:3 ratio

-   16:9 ratio (default)

-   Dynamic

-   Letter

-   Custom (height and width in pixels)
