# Embedding with Power BI

The Power BI service and Power BI Embedded in Azure are coming together to offer a single API for embedding your dashboards and reports.

This will allow you flexibility in how you embed your dashboards and reports.

## A single API

The Power BI REST APIs are being updated for use with to allow for the use of an embed token. This will allow you to embed dashboards and reports into your customer application and give you the control of managing your users and mapping them to a Power BI service user.

## Embedding with an embed token

Embedding with an embed token allows you to embed in your custom application in a similar approach to what was done with the Power BI Embedded Azure service. You control the users within your application and generated an embed token based on a single Power BI user.

The following is a look at what the flow looks like to accomplish this.
