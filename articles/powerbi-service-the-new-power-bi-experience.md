# The new Power BI navigation experience

####    November 2016
We are excited to announce a better way for you to navigate Power BI, quickly get to the dashboards that you access most often, and easily browse through all of your content. During this Preview phase, you'll be able to try it out and [switch back and forth between the old and new navigation experiences](powerbi-service-preview-features.md).

We've redesigned the navigation experience to make it easier for you to find and navigate your Power BI content.
-  streamlined the lists for dashboards, reports, workbooks, and datasets

-  added a separate content area for workbooks

-  created a separate area for your favorite dashboards

-  created a separate area for content that has been shared with you

-  created a separate area for your most-recent content

-   reduced the number of clicks required to accomplish tasks -- combined the lists of content, and the actions you can take on that content, on the same screen

##  Favorite dashboards
We heard from many users that you want to quickly access a few select dashboards that are most important to you. To help you reach the dashboards you go to most, we added a way to favorite those dashboards and make them easily accessible from all your workspaces.
To learn how, see [Favorite a dashboard in Power BI service](powerbi-service-new-favorite-dashboards.md).

##  Content View
We've also improved the way you navigate and access all your Power BI content. Before this, all of your dashboards, reports, and datasets were listed on the left navigation pane. Now, all that content doesn't appear in the navigation pane and instead displays within the context of a workspace. Select a workspace from the left navigation pane and the tiles for the associated content (dashboards, reports, workbooks, datasets) fill the Power BI canvas to the right.
To learn more, see [Workspaces in Power BI](powerbi-service-workspaces.md).

##  Search, filter and sort content
The new content view makes it easier to search, filter and sort your content. To search for a dashboard, report or workbook, type in the search area. Power BI filters to only the content that has your search string as part of the name. You can also filter to display only content that you own or only content shared with you.  Power BI also lets you filter the content view to display alphabetically.
To learn how, see [Search, filter, and sort in Power BI workdspaces](powerbi-service-search-filter-sort.md).

##  Switching between the 2 experiences
You can go back to the old experience any time by selecting the gear icon, and choosing **Settings>Preview Features**. You can also turn it back on anytime later, by visiting the same screen.
To learn how, see [Switch between the new and old Power BI navigation experiences](powerbi-service-preview-features.md).
