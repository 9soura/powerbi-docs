# Open a Power BI report in Reading View  
##   Reading View
Reading View is a great way to explore the data in a Power BI report, without worrying that you'll break something.  You can browse the report, interact with the visualizations, and pin any of the visualizations to your dashboard. 

>[AZURE.NOTE] To edit the report and save your changes, [open it in Editing View](powerbi-service-go-from-reading-view-to-editing-view.md).

1.  [Create a report](powerbi-service-create-a-new-report.md) and open it in Reading View.

2.  Open a report by selecting it from the list in your workspace **Reports** tab.
