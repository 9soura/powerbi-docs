# Accessibility in Power BI Desktop reports

**Power BI Desktop** has features that enable people with disabilities to more easily consume and interact with **Power BI Desktop** reports. These features include the ability to consume a report using the keyboard or a screen reader, tabbing to focus on various objects on a page, and thoughtful use of markers in visualizations.

> **Note:** These accessibility features are available with the June 2017 **Power BI Desktop** and later releases. Additional accessibility functionality is planned for future releases as well.

## Consuming a Power BI Desktop report with a keyboard or screen reader

With the accessibility enhancements, you can consume a **Power BI Desktop** report with a keyboard or a screen reader with the following techniques:

You can **switch focus** between the report page tabs, or objects on a given report page, using **Ctrl+F6**.

-   When focus is on *report page tabs*, use the *Tab* or *Arrow* keys to move focus from one report page to the next. The title of the report page, and whether it is currently selected, is read out by the screen reader. To load the report page currently under focus, use the *Enter* or *Space* key.

-   When focus is on a loaded *report page*, use the *Tab* key to shift focus to each object on the page, which includes all textboxes, images, shapes, and charts. The screen reader reads the type of object, and a description of that object that's provided by its author.Â 


## Tips for creating accessible reports

The following tips can help you create **Power BI Desktop** reports that are more accessible.

-   For **Line**, **Area**, and **Combo** visuals, turn markers on, and use a different *Marker shape* for each line.
    -   To turn *Markers* on, select the **Format** section in the **Visualizations** pane, expand the **Shapes** section, then scroll down to find the **Markers** toggle and turn it to *On*.

    -   Then, select the name of each line (or area, if using an **Area** chart) from the drop-down box in that **Shapes** section. Below the drop-down, you can then adjust many aspects of the marker used for the selected line, including its shape, color, and size.

    -   Using a different *Marker shape* for each line makes it easier for report consumers to differentiate lines (or areas) from each other.


-   Select a *theme* that is high contrast and color blind friendly from the theme gallery, and import it using the [**Theming** preview feature](powerbi-desktop-report-themes.md).

-   For every object on a report, provide *Alt Text*. Doing so ensures that consumers of your report understand what you are trying to communicate with a visual, even if they cannot see the visual, image, shape, or textbox. You can provide *Alt Text* for any object on a **Power BI Desktop** report by selecting the object (such as a visual, shape, etc.) and in the **Visualizations** pane, select the **Format** section, expand **General**, then scroll to the bottom and fill in the **Alt Text** textbox.
