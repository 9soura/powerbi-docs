# Create and Customize Simple Visualizations

*See how to create new bar charts, pie charts, and treemaps, and customize them to suit your reports*

There are two different ways to create a new visualization. The first way is to drag field names from the Fields pane and drop them on the report canvas. By default your visualization will appear as a table of data. The second way is to click on the type of visualization you want to create in the Visualizations pane. With this method, the default is a blank placeholder that resembles the type of visual you are trying to create.

Once you create your graph, map, or chart, you can begin dragging data fields onto the Visualization pane to build and organize your visual. The available fields will change based on the type of visualization that you selected. As you drag and drop data fields, your visualization will automatically update to reflect changes.

You can resize your visualization by selecting it and then dragging the handles in or out. You can also move your visualization anywhere on the canvas by clicking and dragging it. If you want to convert between different types of visualizations, select the one you want to change and simply click on a different Visualization option. Power BI will attempt to convert your selected fields to the new visual type as closely as possible.

As you hover over parts of your visualizations, you'll get a tooltip that contains details about that segment, such as labels and total value.

Select the paintbrush icon on the Visualizations pane to make cosmetic changes to your visual, such as background alignment, title text, and data colors. These options will vary depending on the type of visual you have selected.
