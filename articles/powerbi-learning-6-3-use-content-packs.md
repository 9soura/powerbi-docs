# Use a Content Pack

*Learn how to use a content pack and make your own local edits*

To use an existing content pack, select **Get Data** and choose to **Get** from the Content Pack Library for My Organization. You will see a list of your organization's content packs. Click on a pack to see additional details about it, and select **Connect** to use one.

Once the import is complete, the dashboards, reports, and datasets contained in the selected content pack will appear in the navigation bar on the left-hand side of the screen.

If you want to make changes to items from a content pack, you will be prompted to save your own personal copy. This disconnects these items from the published version of the pack, but creates a copy in your workspace for you to edit and alter. Note that if you create a personal copy, you will no longer be updated with any changes made to the original content pack by its author.

Content packs are a simple way to reuse content across an organization.
