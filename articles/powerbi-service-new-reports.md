# Reports in Power BI

Dashboards, reports, workspaces, and datasets are at the heart of Power BI. A **report** is a multi-perspective view into a dataset, with visualizations that represent different findings and insights from that data.  A report may have a single visualization or pages full of visualizations.

Need help understanding the building blocks that make up Power BI?  See [Power BI - Basic Concepts](powerbi-service-new-basic-concepts.md).

You can [create a report from scratch](powerbi-service-new-create-a-new-report.md) or [have one shared with you](powerbi-service-new-share-unshare-dashboard.md). And for some kinds of data, Power BI will [create a report for you as it adds the dataset](powerbi-service-get-data.md).  

##  View reports in your workspace

You can have more than one report-- as you add reports, their titles are added to your current Power BI workspace. Only one report can be open at a time.

Hover over and select a report to open it in the report editor.

## Tips and troubleshooting

- Don't forget that [creating a report](powerbi-service-new-create-a-new-report.md)  requires a [dataset](powerbi-service-get-data.md).  

- Make sure you understand the difference between [Reading View](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view.md) and [Editing View](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md). 

- Familiarize yourself with the report editor by [Taking a tour](powerbi-service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour.md).

- Modify how your reports display using [page display settings](powerbi-service-change-report-display-settings.md).

- Do you know the difference between filter, highlight, cross-filter, and cross-highlight? If not, see [Filter and highlight data in reports](powerbi-service-about-filters-and-highlighting-in-reports.md).

- [Focus mode](powerbi-service-move-and-resize-a-visualization.md) and [full screen TV mode](powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen.md) -- there is a difference.
