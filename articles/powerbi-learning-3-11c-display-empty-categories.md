# Show Categories With No Data

*See how to display empty columns in your visualizations*

By default, column headings are only viewable in your reports if they contain some data. For example, if you were displaying revenue by country and had no sales in Norway, it would not appear anywhere in your visualization.

To display empty categories, click on the drop-down menu next to the field you want to change in the visualization bucket and select **Show items with no data**. The empty columns will now appear in your visual with blank values.
