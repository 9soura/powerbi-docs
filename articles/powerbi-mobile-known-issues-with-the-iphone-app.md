# Known issues with the iPhone app (Power BI for iOS)


## "We encountered communication failures"

“We encountered communication failures. The failures might be related to proxy settings on your Wi-Fi connection. Switching to a  different Wi-Fi connection may resolve the issue.”

You may see this message if your iPhone internet connection requires a mandatory explicit HTTP proxy configured, either manual or automatic. In this case, the Power BI app won’t work on your iPhone.

### Workaround

Switch the iPhone to another connection that doesn’t require an explicit HTTP proxy setting (i.e., one configured as HTTP Proxy is Off).
