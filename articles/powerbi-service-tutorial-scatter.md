# Tutorial: Scatter charts and Bubble charts in Power BI  

A Scatter chart always has two value axes to show one set of numerical data along a horizontal axis and another set of numerical values along a vertical axis. The chart displays points at the intersection of an x and y numerical value, combining these values into single data points. These data points may be distributed evenly or unevenly across the horizontal axis, depending on the data.

A Bubble chart replaces the data points with bubbles, with the bubble *size* representing an additional dimension of the data.


## When to use a Scatter chart or Bubble chart

### Scatter charts are a great choice:

-   to show relationships between 2 (scatter) or 3 (bubble) **numerical** values.

-  To plot two groups of numbers as one series of xy coordinates.

-  instead of a line chart when you want to change the scale of the horizontal axis    

- to turn the horizontal axis into a logarithmic scale.

- to display worksheet data that includes pairs or grouped sets of values. In a scatter chart, you can adjust the independent scales of the axes to reveal more information about the grouped values.

- to show patterns in large sets of data, for example by showing linear or non-linear trends, clusters, and outliers.

- to compare large numbers of data points without regard to time    The more data that you include in a scatter chart, the better the comparisons that you can make.

### Bubble charts are a great choice:

- if your data has 3 data series that each contain a set of values.

- to present financial data.  Different bubble sizes are useful to visually emphasize specific values.

- to use with quadrants.

## Create a Scatter chart

1.  Open the Retail Analysis Sample in [Editing View](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md) and [add a new report page](powerbi-service-add-a-page-to-a-report.md).

2. From the Fields pane, select **Sales** > **Sales Per Sq Ft** and **Sales** > **Total Sales Variance %**.

3. From the Fields pane, select **District > District Manager**.

3. Convert to a Scatter chart. In the Visualization pane, select the Scatter chart icon

4. Drag **District** from **Details** to **Legend**.

We now have a Scatter chart that plots Total Sales Variance % along the Y axis, and plots Sales Per Square Feet along the X axis.  The data point colors represent districts.  Now let's add a third dimension.

## Create a Bubble chart

1.  From the Fields pane, drag **Sales** > **This Year Sales** to the **Size** area.

2. Hover over a bubble.  The size of the bubble reflects the value of **This Year Sales**.

3. Optionally, [format the visualization colors, labels, titles, background, and more](powerbi-service-getting-started-with-color-formatting-and-axis-properties.md).

## Troubleshooting

### **Your Scatter chart has only one data point**  

Does your scatter chart have only one data point that aggregates all the values on the X and Y axes?  Or maybe it aggregates all the values along a single horizontal or vertical line?

1.  Add a field to the **Details** area to tell Power BI how to group the values. The field must be unique for each point you want to plot.  

    * Like a simple row number or ID field:

        ![](media/powerbi-service-tutorial-scatter/PBI_scatter_tshoot.png)

    * Or if you don’t have that in your data, you can create a field that concatenates your X and Y values together into something unique per point:  

        ![](media/powerbi-service-tutorial-scatter/PBI_scatter_tshoot2.png)

      Use the Query Editor to add an Index Column to your dataset.  Then add this column to the **Details** area of your visualization.
