Dashboards are a portal to your company's life cycle and processes. A dashboard is an overview, a single place to monitor the current state of the business.

## Create dashboards in the Power BI service
**You don't create dashboards in the mobile apps.** 

To see more dashboards on your mobile device, you need to create or connect to them on your computer. 

1. Go to the Power BI service ([https://www.powerbi.com](https://www.powerbi.com)) and [sign up for an account](powerbi-service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md).

2. [Create your own Power BI dashboards](powerbi-service-create-a-dashboard.md), or connect to existing [content packs for a variety of services](powerbi-content-packs-services.md).

Here's a Power BI dashboard in the Power BI service:

## View dashboards in the Power BI mobile apps

Then these same dashboards will appear automatically in your Power BI mobile app. Dashboards refresh in real time, automatically, so no need to manually refresh them.

Here's the same dashboard as seen on a mobile phone:

![](media/powerbi-mobile-create-dashboard/power-bi-iphone-dashboard.png)

From here, you can:

- Share the dashboard with colleagues ![](media/powerbi-mobile-create-dashboard/PBI_Andr_InviteIcon.png).
- [Make the dashboard one of your favorites](powerbi-mobile-favorites.md) ![](media/powerbi-mobile-create-dashboard/power-bi-mobile-not-favorite-icon.png).
- Tap the arrow next to the dashboard name to go back to My Workspace.
