## System requirements

-   A valid Dynamics CRM Online 2016 or later instance (the content pack will not work with an on-premises CRM version). If you do not have 2016 or later

-   An administrator must enable the OData endpoint in the site settings. 

-   An account with less than 100k records in any of the tables. Note if the account has access to more than 100k records the import will fail. 

<a name="FindingParams"></a>
## Finding parameters

The address of the instance can be found in the URL bar of your browser. It typically has the format: `https://[instance_name].crm.dynamics.com`. 

Note: only Dynamics CRM 2016 endpoints are supported in the content pack. The content pack will not work with earlier versions of CRM Online, please use the Power BI Desktop to connect directly to your account. 

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble connecting, please confirm:  
- you're providing the correct instance URL (check with your admin)  
- the instance is CRM Online 2016  
- the OData endpoint is enabled  

You may also try connecting directly in the PBI Desktop, with the OData URL https://[instance_name].crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v8.0/`. 

If you confirm you have Dynamics CRM Online 2016, however you're still hitting issues connecting, please contact your CRM Admin to confirm you have all available updates.

If you do not have CRM Online 2016 or later, please use the Power BI Desktop to connect directly to your account. 

If you see an error "Data refresh failed as query exceeded the maximum limit of 100000 records.", please consider connecting directly from the Power BI Desktop or leveraging the CRM solution template.
