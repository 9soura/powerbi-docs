# Microsoft Dynamics CRM content pack for Power&nbsp;BI

The Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online content pack for Power BI allows you to easily access and analyze your data. The content pack uses the OData feed to create a descriptive model, with all the entities and measures needed such as Accounts, Activities, Opportunities, Product, Leads, Users and more. The data is filtered down to opportunities that were created or closed in the last 365 days and will be refreshed daily.

Connect to the [Dynamics CRM Online content pack](https://app.powerbi.com/getdata/services/microsoft-dynamics-crm) or read more about the [Dynamics CRM Online integration](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/integrations/microsoft_dynamicscrm) with Power BI.

Note: this content pack requires an administrator must enable the OData endpoint in the site settings. More details on requirements below.

## How to connect

1.  Select Get Data at the bottom of the left navigation pane.

**What Now?**

- Try [asking a question in the Q&A box](powerbi-service-q-and-a.md) at the top of the dashboard

- [Change the tiles](powerbi-service-edit-a-tile-in-a-dashboard.md) in the dashboard.

- [Select a tile](powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles.md) to open the underlying report.

- While your dataset will be schedule to refreshed daily, you can change the refresh schedule or try refreshing it on demand using **Refresh Now**

## System requirements

-   You need to specify valid OData URL for a Dynamics CRM Online instance (the content pack will not work with an on-premises CRM version).

-   An administrator must enable the OData endpoint in the site settings. 

-   The user account/identity that you use to access Dynamics CRM Online must be the same as the one you are signed up for using with Power BI. When logging into CRM Online, you will be auto-signed into CRM with the same identity you are using for Power BI. If you wish to sign into CRM Online with a different account, please register as a Power BI user using the same account. We hope to resolve this issue in an upcoming release. 

## Finding parameters

The address of the OData endpoint can be found by navigating to **Microsoft Dynamics CRM \> Settings \> Customizations \> Developer Resources**.  The OData URL is listed under **Service Endpoints**.  It typically has the format: `https://[instance_name].crm.dynamics.com/XRMServices/2011/OrganizationData.svc`

## Troubleshooting

If you see a "Login failed" message when trying to connect to your Dynamics CRM account, confirm that you're signing into Power BI with the same account you would use to access the CRM Online OData feed. Try logging into the feed in your browser as well, to test it there.

Ask your admin to confirm the correct OData URL, and that the OData endpoint is enabled.

If you're still having issues, open a support ticket to reach the Power BI team:
