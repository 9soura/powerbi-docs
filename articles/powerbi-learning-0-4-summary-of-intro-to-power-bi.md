# Review the first module, and What's Next

Let’s do a quick review of what we covered in this first module.

**Power BI** is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your data into interactive insights. You can use data from single basic sources, such as an Excel workbook, or pull data in from multiple databases and cloud sources to create complex datasets and reports. Power BI can be as straightforward as you want, or as enterprise-ready as your complex global business requires.

Power BI consists of three main elements – the **Power BI Desktop**, the **Power BI service**, and **Power BI Mobile** – which all work collectively to let you create, interact with, share, and consume your data how you want it.

We discussed the basic building blocks in Power BI too, which are:

-   **Visualizations** – a visual representation of data, sometimes just called visuals
-   **Datasets** – a collection of data that Power BI uses to create visualizations
-   **Reports** – a collection of visuals from a dataset, spanning one or more pages
-   **Dashboards** – a single page collection of visuals, built from a report
-   **Tiles** – a single visualization found in a report or dashboard

From there, we took a look at Power BI in a video tour with our Tour Guide, **Will Thompson**. Will gave us a quick overview of how you can analyze and visualize data with Power BI.

In **Power BI Desktop**, we connected to a basic Excel file, created visualizations, then published those visualizations to the service. Even if you use Power BI only with your Excel workbooks, you can gain amazing visual insights with those Excel workbooks, and both interact and share it in ways never before possible.

In the **Power BI service**, we created a dashboard with just a few clicks.

We continued in the Power BI service and used a **Content Pack** – a ready-made collection of visuals and reports – and connected to a **software service** to populate the Content Pack, and bring that data to life. We also used natural language queries to ask questions of our answers, and let Power BI create visuals based on those questions. Lastly, we set up a refresh schedule for our data, so we know when we go back to the Power BI service, that data will be fresh.

Okay, we’re at the end of the first module. Congratulations! See you in the next module.
