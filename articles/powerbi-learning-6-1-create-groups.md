# Create Groups in Power BI

*See how to create a new group, set privacy levels, and invite your first members*

Groups are a way to define a set of users who have access to particular dashboards, reports, and datasets. Groups tie into Office365 groups, so if you already have those set up to manage email and calendars, you can extend that organization to Power BI.

To create a group, first log in to the Power BI service. Select **My Workspace** in the left-hand side navigation bar, and then select **Create a Group**. This opens the Create a Group dialog. Create a unique name for your group, set the privacy level as desired, and invite members by adding their email address (including security groups and distribution lists).

As you add people to your group, their email addresses will be listed at the bottom of the dialog. When you have finished adding, select **Save**. Your new group will appear at the top of the left-hand side navigation bar.
