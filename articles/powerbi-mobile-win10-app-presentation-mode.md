# View Power BI presentation mode on Surface Hub & Windows 10

You can display reports in presentation mode on Surface Hub, and display dashboards, reports, and tiles in full-screen mode on Windows 10 devices. 

![Report in full-screen mode](media/powerbi-mobile-win10-app-presentation-mode/power-bi-presentation-mode.png)

Presentation and full-screen modes are useful for displaying Power BI at a meeting or conference, or on a dedicated projector in an office, or even just for maximizing space on a small screen. 

In full-screen mode in the Power BI mobile app, all the "chrome" such as the navigation and menu bars is removed, except the page tabs and filter pane in reports.

When you display a report in presentation mode on Surface Hub, you can draw on the pages with different colors of ink and navigate between the pages of the report.

You can also [display dashboards and reports in full-screen mode from the Power BI service](powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen.md) on the web.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Presentation mode is different from [focus mode for tiles](powerbi-mobile-tiles-in-the-win10phone-app.md).
