# Share Dashboards with your organization

*Discover how to share dashboards with others in your organization*

We've already seen how Power BI helps you find data, collect it in a data model, and build reports and visualizations on using that data. We've also seen how you can publish those reports to the Power BI service, and create dashboards that help you monitor your information over time. All these features are even more powerful when you share your insights with others in your organization. Fortunately, sharing your dashboards is easy.

To share a dashboard, open it in the Power BI service and select the **Share** link in the top right-hand corner.

The **Share Dashboard** page appears, where you can select the **Invite** section, then fill in the **Email address** input box with people you'd like to grant access to your dashboard. Power BI checks the email addresses as you type them with accounts in your domain and Office 365 domain, and auto-complete when possible. You can also copy and paste email addresses into this box, or use a distribution list, security group, or Office 365 group to reach multiple people at once.

If you selected the checkbox (near the bottom) to *send email notification to recipients*, then your recipients will receive an email letting them know that you shared a dashboard with them, including a link the dashboard. You can add a note to the email they will receive, or send the note that Power BI created for you (it's in the box directly below where you enter their email addresses).

> Note: Recipients without an existing Power BI account will be taken through the sign-up process before viewing your dashboard.

Anyone with whom you share a dashboard can see and interact with it exactly as you do. However, they have *read-only* access to the underlying reports, and they have *no access* to the underlying datasets.

You can also select the **Shared With** tab on the Share Dashboard page to see the people with whom you have previously shared this dashboard.
