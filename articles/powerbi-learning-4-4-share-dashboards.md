# Share Dashboards With Your Organization

*Discover how to share dashboards with others in your organization*

We've already seen how with Power BI you can track your own information, collect it in one model, and build reports and visualizations on top of the data. We've also looked at how you can publish those reports on the Power BI service and create dashboards that help you monitor your information over time. All these features are even more powerful when you share your insights with others in your organization. Fortunately, sharing your dashboards is very easy!

To share a dashboard, first open it in the Power BI service. Select the **Share** link in the top right-hand corner to open the Share Dashboard page. Enter the email address of the person with whom you would like to share this dashboard in the **Email address** input box. Power BI will check the email addresses in your domain and Office365 domain, and auto-complete when possible. You can also copy and paste email addresses into this box, or use a distribution list, security group, or Office365 group to reach multiple people at once.

Your recipients will receive an email letting them know that you shared a dashboard with them, including a link to its home on the Power BI service. (Note that recipients without an existing Power BI account will be taken through the sign-up process before viewing your dashboard.) Anyone with whom you share a dashboard will see and interact with it exactly as you do. However, they will have read-only access to the underlying reports and no access to the datasets.

Select the **Shared With** tab on the Share Dashboard page to see the people with whom you have previously shared this dashboard.
