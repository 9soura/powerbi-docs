# Getting Started With Power BI Desktop

[![Welcome to Power BI Desktop](http://img.youtube.com/vi/meDUu1sFP3Q/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meDUu1sFP3Q)

*Learn how to use Power BI Desktop to get your data, create reports, and publish to online dashboards.*

Let's get an overview of Power BI Desktop by connecting to data, using it to create a report, and publishing that report on the Power BI service.

On the Getting Started splash screen in Power BI Desktop, select **Get Data** and then select a source from the available list to connect to your data. You can preview your source in the Navigator before connecting, and select the specific tables you want to use in your modelling. Once you've connected to your data, the selected tables and columns will appear in the Fields list on the right side of the screen.

To create a simple visualization based on your data, simply drag and drop two or more columns from the Fields list onto the same spot on the canvas. You can use a different type of chart or graph by changing the Visualizations options, including bar charts, scatter plots, and even interactive maps for geographic data. You can create multiple visualizations on the same page, and have multiple pages in a single report.

To publish your report, select **Publish** and sign in to the Power BI service. Once your report -- including the data and all visualizations -- has been uploaded, you'll be given a link to view it online in the service. Hover over a visualization in the service and select the **Pin** icon to add it to a dashboard.
