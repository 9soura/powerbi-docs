# How to Use Scatter Charts

*Watch and learn how to create and customize scatter charts*

If you want to compare two different measures, for example unit sales verses revenue, a common visualization to do so is a scatter chart.

To create a blank chart, select **Scatter chart** from the Visualizations pane. Drag and drop the two measures you want to compare from the Fields pane to the X Axis and Y Axis options buckets. At this point, your scatter chart probably just has a small bubble in the center of the visual -- you need to add a measure to the Details bucket to indicate how you would like to segment your data. For example, if are comparing item sales and revenue, perhaps you want to split the data by category or manufacturer or month of sale.

Adding an additional field to the Legend bucket will color-code your bubbles according to the field's value. You can also add a field to the Size bucket to alter the bubble size according to that value. You can create an animation of your bubble chart's changes over time by adding a time-based field to the Play Axis bucket. Click on a bubble during an animation to see a trace of its path.

Scatter charts have a number of visual formatting options as well, such as turning on an outline for each colored bubble and toggling individual labels.
