# Usage metrics for dashboards and reports

##    Why are usage metrics important to me?
If you create dashboards and reports, usage metrics help you understand their impact. When you run usage metrics you'll discover how those dashboards and reports are being used throughout your organization. Knowing how your content is being used helps you demonstrate your impact and prioritize your efforts. Your usage metrics may show that one of your reports is used daily by a huge segment of the organization and it may show that a dashboard you created isn't being viewed at all. This type of feedback is invaluable in guiding your work efforts.

>**NOTE**: Usage metrics is a Power BI Pro feature. 

## About the usage metrics report
Selecting **Usage metrics** creates a Power BI report.  This report looks very similar to to the Power BI reports you're already familiar with. It's a single page with text and visualizations that can be explored, exported, and pinned to dashboards. The usage metrics report shows the last 90 days' worth of data.

The usage metrics report won't show up in **Recent**, **Workspaces**, **Favorites**, or other content lists. It cannot be added to an app. If you pin a tile from the usage metrics report to a dashboard, that dashboard cannot be added to an app.

##    Save the usage metrics report
Use **Save as** to save and customize a copy of the report. Whether you are saving the usage report for a dashboard or a report, Power BI creates a new dataset made up of all the datasets used in the current workspace (the workspace that contains the report or dashboard you ran metrics on).


##    Considerations and limitations
Q:    I can't run usage metrics on a dashboard or report
A:    You can only see usage metrics for content you own or have permissions to edit.

Q:    I can't run usage metrics on any content.
A1:    Admins have the option to turn off this feature for their organization.  Contact your Admin to see if this is the case. 
A2:    Usage metrics is a Power BI Pro feature.

Q:    The data doesn't seem up-to-date
A:    It can take up to 24 hours for data to update.
