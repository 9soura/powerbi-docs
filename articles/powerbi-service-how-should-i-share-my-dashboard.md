# How should I share Power BI dashboards, reports, and tiles?  

In Power BI you can collaborate on, share, and distribute dashboards, reports, and tiles in several different ways. Each has its advantages. You can:

- [Publish a report](powerbi-service-how-should-i-share-my-dashboard.md#publish-to-the-web) to the web.
- [Share a dashboard](powerbi-service-how-should-i-share-my-dashboard.md#share-a-dashboard-with-colleagues-and-others) with your colleagues and others.
- [Collaborate on a dashboard in a group workspace](powerbi-service-how-should-i-share-my-dashboard.md#create-a-dashboard-in-a-group), then share with colleagues outside the group.

    *This is a Power BI preview feature. Want to [opt in for preview features](powerbi-service-preview-features.md)?*

- [Create a content pack and publish it](powerbi-service-how-should-i-share-my-dashboard.md#create-a-content-pack-and-publish-it) to your whole organization or to a security or distribution list.
- [Share a snapshot of a tile](powerbi-service-how-should-i-share-my-dashboard.md#share-a-snapshot-of-a-tile-from-a-power-bi-mobile-app) from a Power BI mobile app.
- [Print or save as PDF](powerbi-service-how-should-i-share-my-dashboard.md#print-or-save-as-PDF-or-other-static-file) or other static file format.

In most cases, your colleagues need to [sign up for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) before they can see your dashboards. Depending on the content you want to share, you and they may need Power BI free or Pro licenses.
Here's a summary of how sharing and collaborating works, depending on which you do. Details follow below.

## Collaborate on a dashboard in a group  
Groups in Power BI are built on Office 365 groups. Think of a group as a workspace where you and your colleagues can collaborate together on your Power BI dashboards and reports. When you're a member of a group, you can create a dashboard in the group workspace. Everyone in the group can view, interact with, and edit the dashboard and its reports. They have the same permission you have. 

If you just want to share a finished dashboard with colleagues, don't add those colleagues to the group. Instead, [share the dashboard](powerbi-service-how-should-i-share-my-dashboard.md#share-a-dashboard-with-colleagues-and-others) with them, or [create a content pack](powerbi-service-how-should-i-share-my-dashboard.md#create-a-content-pack-and-publish-it) and publish it. 

To use groups in Power BI, you and your colleagues need a Power BI Pro license. More about [creating groups in Power BI](powerbi-service-create-a-group-in-power-bi.md).

## Share a dashboard with colleagues and others 
When you share a dashboard, those you share it with can view it and interact with it, but can't edit it. They can see the same data that you see in the dashboard and reports. Your colleagues can share the dashboard with other colleagues, if you allow them to. Those outside your organization can view and interact with the dashboard, but can't share it. More about [sharing a dashboard](powerbi-service-share-unshare-dashboard.md).

### Share a dashboard with colleagues outside a group  
If you're a member of a group in Power BI, you can share the group's dashboards with colleagues outside the group. It works the same as [sharing a dashboard with colleagues](powerbi-service-share-unshare-dashboard.md).

## Create an organizational content pack and publish it  
Organizational content packs are a great way to distribute your Power BI insights with your colleagues. You create a dashboard with its reports and datasets, either in your own workspace or in a group. Then you publish them all together as a content pack &#151; either for your whole organization or for those in a specific security group or distribution list. When those colleagues go to the Content Pack Library for your organization, they see your content pack along with any others they have permission to see. More about [organizational content packs](powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-introduction.md).  

## Publish to the web

When you publish Power BI reports to the web, you can embed interactive visualizations in blog posts, websites, social media, and other online communications, on any device. Publishing to web is available on reports in your personal workspace that you can edit. You can't publish to the web reports that were shared with you, and anyone on the Internet can view your reports. They don't need a Power BI license, but you have no control over who can see your reports. More about [publishing to the web](powerbi-service-publish-to-web.md).

## Share a snapshot of a tile from a Power BI mobile app
When you share a tile from one of the Power BI mobile apps, you're sharing a snapshot of the tile. Your recipients see the tile exactly as it was when you sent the mail. They can't open the dashboard. You can send snapshots of tiles to anyone &#151; not just colleagues in the same email domain.

In some of the mobile apps, you can add annotations before you send the snapshot of the tile.

Share a snapshot of a tile from:

- The [iPad app (Power BI for iOS)](powerbi-mobile-annotate-and-share-a-snapshot-from-the-ipad-app.md)
- The [iPhone app (Power BI for iOS)](powerbi-mobile-annotate-and-share-a-tile-from-the-iphone-app.md)
- The [Power BI app for Android phones](powerbi-mobile-annotate-and-share-a-tile-from-the-android-app.md)
- The [Power BI app for Windows 10 devices](powerbi-mobile-annotate-and-share-a-snapshot-from-the-windows-app.md)

## Print or save as PDF or other static file

You can also print or save as PDF (or other static file format) an entire dashboard, a dashboard tile, a report page, or a report visualization from the Power BI service. Reports can only be printed one page at a time -- you can't print the entire report at once. More about [printing or saving as a static file](powerbi-service-print.md).
