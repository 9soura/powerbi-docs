# Edit Tile Details

*Learn how change a tile's details, such as title and link behavior*

Once you've built a dashboard, you can edit its tiles in the Power BI service to make a few formatting changes.

Hover over a tile and select the pen icon to open the Tile Details pane. From here you can change the tile's Title and Subtitle.

By default, when you click on a dashboard tile you will be taken to the report from which it originated. To change this behavior, use the Set custom link field in the Tile Details pane. (One popular use of this feature is to take users to the organization homepage when clicking on a logo image.)
