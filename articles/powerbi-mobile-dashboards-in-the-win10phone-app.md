# Dashboards in the Windows 10 phone app for Power BI  

Dashboards are a portal to your company's life cycle and processes. A dashboard is an overview, a single place to monitor the current state of the business. 

Power BI brings together data from different types of data sources &#151; for example, services such as Salesforce, content packs from your organization, databases, and Excel workbooks.

You [create and connect to dashboards in the Power BI service](powerbi-service-dashboards.md). Then in the [Windows 10 phone app for Microsoft Power BI](powerbi-mobile-win10phone-app-get-started.md), you can explore these same dashboards.
