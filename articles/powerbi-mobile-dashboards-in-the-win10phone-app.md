# Dashboards in the Power BI mobile app for Windows 10  

Dashboards are a portal to your company's life cycle and processes. A dashboard is an overview, a single place to monitor the current state of the business. 

Power BI brings together data from different types of data sources &#151; for example, services such as Salesforce, content packs from your organization, databases, and Excel workbooks.

You don't create dashboards on your Windows 10 mobile device. In the Power BI service ([https://www.powerbi.com](https://www.powerbi.com)) on your computer, you [create dashboards](powerbi-service-dashboards.md) or [connect to built-in dashboards for services](powerbi-content-packs-services.md) such as Salesforce.

Then in the [Power BI mobile app for Windows 10](powerbi-mobile-win10phone-app-get-started.md), you can explore these same dashboards.

## View dashboards on your Windows 10 device  
1.  Open the Power BI app on your Windows 10 device and sign in.

    Need to [download the app](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=526478) first?

2.  Tap a dashboard to open it.

    Power BI dashboards look a little different on your Windows 10 phone. All the tiles appear the same width, and they're arranged one after another from top to bottom.

5.  In the dashboard, you can:

    -   Tap the **Invite** icon ![](media/powerbi-mobile-dashboards-in-the-win10phone-app/PBI_Andr_InviteIcon.png) to [share your dashboard](powerbi-mobile-share-a-dashboard-from-the-win10phone-app.md) with a colleague.
    -   Tap the ellipsis (...) > **Pin to Start** to [pin the dashboard to your Windows Start screen](powerbi-mobile-pin-dashboard-from-win10phone-app.md). 

    -   [Tap a tile](powerbi-mobile-tiles-in-the-win10phone-app.md) to open and interact with it.
    

6.  To go back to the dashboards home page, tap the back arrow or back button.

## View dashboards in landscape mode
You can also view dashboards in landscape mode, just by turning your phone. The dashboard layout changes from a series of tiles to a view of the whole dashboard &#151; you see all of the dashboard’s tiles laid out as they are in the Power BI service.

You can use the “pinch” gesture to zoom in and out on different areas of your dashboard, pan to navigate it. And you can still [tap a tile](powerbi-mobile-tiles-in-the-win10phone-app.md) to open the tile in focus mode and interact with your data.
