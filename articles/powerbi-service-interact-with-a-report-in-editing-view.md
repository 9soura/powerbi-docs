# Interact with a report in Editing View in Power BI

In report [Editing View](powerbi-service-go-from-reading-view-to-editing-view.md), you have lots of flexibility in exploring and designing a report. All the [Reading View](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view.md) functionality is available -- plus lots more.

>**NOTE**: If you don't see something on this page, use the Table of Contents to the left.


### Add a page

No need to crowd your report pages.  If you need more room, [add a new page](powerbi-service-add-a-page-to-a-report.md).


### Change the way a report page is displayed

[How do you want your report pages to be viewed?](powerbi-service-change-report-display-settings.md)  Set rendering rules, display ratios, and absolute page sizes (in pixels).

### Add visualizations

[Create visualizations](powerbi-service-visualizations-for-reports.md) on the pages of your report.

### Filtering and highlighting in reports

There are many ways to [filter and highlight data in reports](powerbi-service-about-filters-and-highlighting-in-reports.md). In Editing View, you can [add filters to a page](powerbi-service-add-a-filter-to-a-report.md) and when you [share your dashboard](powerbi-service-share-unshare-dashboard.md), your viewers can [interact with the filters in Reading View](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view.md).

### Delete a page

[Report pages can be deleted](powerbi-service-delete-a-page-from-a-report.md), even if they're not blank.

### Create a new report

[Create a brand new report](powerbi-service-create-a-new-report.md).

### Reorder the pages

### Rename a report

Don't like the name of the report? [Rename it](powerbi-service-rename-a-report.md). 

### Save a report

[Save your report](powerbi-service-save-a-report.md) so you can use it again and share it with colleagues. The name of the saved report is added to your Power BI navigation pane.

### Share a report

See [share a dashboard](powerbi-service-share-unshare-dashboard.md).

### Delete a report
