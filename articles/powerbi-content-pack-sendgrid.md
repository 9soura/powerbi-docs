# SendGrid content pack for Power BI

[← Services in Power BI](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/topics/88770-services-in-power-bi)

The Power BI content pack for SendGrid allows you to extract insights and statistics from your SendGrid account. Using the SendGrid content pack you can visualize your SendGrid statistics in a dashboard.


The following metrics are available in the SendGrid dashboard:
-   Overall email statistics - Requests, Delivered, Bounced, Spam Blocked, Spam Report, etc.
-   Email statistics by category
-   Email statistics by geography
-   Email statistics by ISP
-   Email statistics by device, client, browser


To import data from your SendGrid account, complete the following steps:

1.  Select **Get Data** at the bottom of the left navigation pane.

Plus you can ask a [question in ](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/474566-q-a-in-power-bi)[Q&A](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/474566-q-a-in-power-bi) or click a tile to [open the underlying report](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/425669-when-you-click-a-tile-in-a-dashboard) and [c](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/424878-edit-a-tile-resize-move-rename-delete)[](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/424878-edit-a-tile-resize-move-rename-delete)[hange the tiles](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/424878-edit-a-tile-resize-move-rename-delete) in the dashboard. 

### Scheduled Refresh

The SendGrid content pack is configured by default to refresh once a day.

### Using Q&A to get insights from your SendGrid data using natural language queries

Within your SendGrid dashboard, you can use Q&A as a way of using natural language to query your SendGrid data. Because of the limitations of the SendGrid data model, keep in mind that you will not be able to get meaningful answers to questions that feature more than one dimension (for example, "total email requests by category and geography").
