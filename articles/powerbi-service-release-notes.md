#Q&A in Power BI Preview
[← Getting Started](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/topics/63037-getting-started)

Sometimes the fastest way to get an answer from your data, is to ask a question using natural language.  For example, "what were total sales last year."  Use Q&A to explore your Excel data using intuitive, natural language capabilities and receive answers in the form of charts and graphs. Q&A is different from a search engine -- Q&A only provides results about the data in Power BI.

How does Q&A know how to answer data-specific questions? It relies on the names of the tables, columns, and calculated fields in a workbook or other dataset. So what you call things in your workbook is important!

##Q&A basic concepts

The Q&A text box is located at the top of a dashboard. To see and use Q&A, a dashboard name must be selected in the navigation pane.

As you type a question, Power BI Q&A picks the best visualization to display your answer; and the visualization changes dynamically as you modify the question.

When you type a query, Power BI looks for an answer in any dataset that has a tile on that dashboard.  If all the tiles are from *datasetA*, then your answer will come from *datasetA*.  If there are tiles from *datasetA* and *datasetB*, then Q&A will search for the best answer from those 2 datasets.

**TIP**:  So be careful, if you only have one tile from *datasetA* and you remove it from your dashboard, Q&A will no longer have access to *datasetA*.

##Types of questions to ask of an uploaded Excel workbook

When you have a workbook prepared for Q&A, you are on your way to start asking questions. Here’s a sample of the types of questions you can ask:

- Show &lt;table\>  
	Examples:  
	Show sales  
	Show orders

- Average &lt;column\> (if the column has number values)  
	Example: Average employee age

- Show &lt;column\>, where &lt;column\> is between &lt;range\>  
    Examples:  
	Show products, where price is between $10 and $30  
	Show sales, where date is between 2012 and 2014

-   Show &lt;column\>, where &lt;column\> is before &lt;value\>  
    Examples:  
	Show products, where date sold is before December 9th, 2014  
	Show employees, where date of birth is after 3/3/1985

-   &lt;measure\> by &lt;column name\>  
	a. Year over year growth by year  
	b. Total sales by product  
	c. Number of sales by location  
	d. Total profit and total cost by product

-   &lt;measure\> by &lt;column name\> for &lt;specific entity within another column\>  
	Example: Total sales by sales rep for Surface Pro 3
