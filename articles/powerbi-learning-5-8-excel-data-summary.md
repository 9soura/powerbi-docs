# Excel data in Power BI summary

In this collection of topics, you learned how easy it is to leverage your existing Excel workbook files by uploading and exploring them in Power BI. You can upload Excel workbooks with simple tables or workbooks created with Excel's more advanced BI features like Power Pivot and Power View.

You also learned how to connect to **Excel** files that reside on **OneDrive for Business**, and use Power BI's **automatic** refresh features to keep your reports and dashboards up-to-date as you make changes in your workbook.

## What's Next

**Congratulations!** You've completed the **Power BI and Excel** section of the **Guided Learning** course for Power BI. That was easy, wasn't it? Power BI and Excel make a great team, and makes it easy for you to use them together.

With all the knowledge you've gained, and your ability to create compelling visuals in reports and dashboards, you're probably ready to share your masterpieces. The next section, **Publishing and Sharing**, shows you how to do just that.

See you in the next section!
