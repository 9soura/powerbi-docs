# Explore Time-Based Data

*See how to navigate date hierarchies in your data models*

It's very easy to analyze time-based data with Power BI. The modeling tools in Power BI Desktop include generated fields that let you drill down through years, quarters, months, and days with a single click.  

When you create a table visualization in your report using a date field, it will automatically include breakdowns by time period. Grapic charts display data at the year level by default, but you can change that by turning on **Drill Down** in the top right-hand corner of the visual. Now when you click on the bars or lines in your chart, it will drill down to the next level of time hierarchy, for example from years to quarters. To move back up through the time hierarchy, click on **Drill Up** in the top left-hand corner of the visual.

You can also drill down through all of your data rather than a selected period by using the **Drill All* double-arrow icon, also in the top right-hand corner of the visual.

As long as your model has a date field, Power BI will automatically generate different views for different time hierarchies!
