# Dashboards in the Power BI for Windows app

Dashboards are a portal to your company's life cycle and processes. A dashboard is an overview, a single place to monitor the current state of the business.

Microsoft Power BI comes with built-in dashboards for some data sources such as Salesforce, and you create your own [dashboards in Power BI](powerbi-service-dashboards.md).

Then you see those same dashboards in the Power BI for Windows app, and you can see dashboards your colleagues share with you.

### View dashboards in your Power BI for Windows app

1.  Open the Power BI for Windows app.

    On the app home page, you see the first of your dashboards.

2.  If you have a lot of them, tap **Dashboards** to see them all.

3.  Tap a dashboard to open it.

4.  Or you can create a dashboard: Tap **Add a New Dashboard.**
