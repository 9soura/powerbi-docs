# Style Your Reports With page layout and formatting

*Learn how to add visual design elements to your reports such as page layout and formatting.*

Power BI Desktop gives you the ability to control the layout and formatting of your report pages, such as size and orientation.

By default, report pages are 16:9. To change the page size, select the **Page Size** menu from the Home tab. Other options for page size are 4x3 (more square aspect ratio), and Dynamic (the page will stretch to fill the available space). Keep in mind that you may need to resize your visuals after changing the page size to ensure that they're completely on the canvas.

Use the **Page View** menu from the Home tab to change the way your report pages scale. The available options include Fit To Page (default), Fit To Width, and Actual Size.

Use the visual formatting options with no visualization selected to see additional options for page size and page background. You can specify a custom page size by inches or pixels, and change the background color of the entire report.
