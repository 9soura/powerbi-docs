# View SQL Server Reporting Services mobile reports and KPIs in the iPhone app (Power BI for iOS)  

The iPhone app for Microsoft Power BI for iOS offers live, touch-enabled mobile access to your important on-premises business information. 

 ![](media/powerbi-mobile-iphone-kpis-mobile-reports/PBI_iPh_SSMRP_MobRpt.png)

[Create Reporting Services mobile reports](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652547.aspx) with SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher and publish them to the [Reporting Services web portal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt637133.aspx). Create KPIs right in the web portal. Organize them in folders and mark your favorites, so you can find them easily. 

Then in the iPhone app for Power BI, view the mobile reports and KPIs, organized in folders or collected as favorites. 

>**Note**: Your iPhone needs to be at least an iPhone 5, running at least iOS 8.0.

## Explore samples without an SSRS server

Even if you don't have access to a Reporting Services web portal, you can still explore the features of Reporting Services mobile reports. 

1. Tap the global navigation button ![](media/powerbi-mobile-iphone-kpis-mobile-reports/power-bi-iphone-global-nav-button.png) in the upper-left corner, scroll down and tap **Reporting Services samples**.

2.  Browse to interact with the sample KPIs and mobile reports.

3. Tap **Remove Server**.

## Create Reporting Services mobile reports and KPIs

You don't create Reporting Services KPIs and mobile reports in the Power BI mobile app. You create them in SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher and a SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services web portal.

- [Create your own Reporting Services mobile reports](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652547.aspx), and publish them to the Reporting Services web portal.
- Create [KPIs on the Reporting Services web portal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt683632.aspx)
