# Introduction to Cortana for Power BI

## How do Cortana and Power BI work together?

Ask questions and get answers in the form of Cortana report pages.

You can search for your COrtana-enabled Power BI report pages through Cortana and view them in COrtana without navigating to Power BI.  You can use natural language to apply filters and retrieve a filtered view of the Cortana reports. You'll be able to interact with the visualizations as you would in Power BI --  filtering, highlighting, opening in Power BI, and much more.  

The "answers" are actually a special type of report called a *Cortana report page* that are designed specifically for display by Cortana. Dataset owners can [create the Cortana report pages in Power BI](powerbi-service-cortana-desktop-entity-cards.md). These report pages should be designed to answer the most-common questions.   

Colleagues can even ask questions with filters and the report page that Cortana displays will have those filters applied. For example, if you have a report page named "2016 sales data", you can ask for:
-    "2016 sales data" and see the complete unfiltered entity card
-    "2016 sales data for Surface" and see the entity card filtered to show only sales data for Surface.

##  Next steps

-    Before Cortana can look for answers in your Power BI datasets and reports, you'll need to [enable this feature in the Power BI service](powerbi-service-Cortana-enable.md).  

- If you are a dataset owner, use Power BI to [create special reports designed specifically for Cortana](powerbi-service-Cortana-Desktop-entity-cards.md).
