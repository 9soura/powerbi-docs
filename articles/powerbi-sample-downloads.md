### Explore the Power BI sample workbooks

When you first open a sample workbook, you may see two warnings.

-   The first says the workbook is in Protected View. Select **Enable Editing**.

-   The second says the workbook has external data connections. Select **Enable Content**.

Each workbook contains several sheets:

-   The Info tab provides information about obviEnce, the company that created the sample.

-   The other tabs are Power View sheets with the report visuals. You may need to [enable the Power View add-in](https://support.office.com/article/Create-a-Power-View-sheet-in-Excel-2013-B23D768D-7586-47FE-97BD-89B80967A405#__toc328591957).

The workbook contains the actual data, but it's in the data model, not in worksheets.

-   To see the data, on the **PowerPivot** tab, select **Manage Data Model**.

    Don't see the PowerPivot tab? [Enable the Power Pivot add-in](https://support.office.com/article/Start-Power-Pivot-in-Microsoft-Excel-2013-add-in-A891A66D-36E3-43FC-81E8-FC4798F39EA8).
