# Troubleshooting refresh scenarios

Here you can find information regarding different scenarios you may face when refreshing data within the Power BI service.

## Dashboard doesn't reflect changes after refresh  
Please wait about 10-15 minutes for refresh to be reflected in the dashboard tiles.  If it is still not showing up, re-pin the visualization to the dashboard.

## GatewayNotReachable when setting credentials  
You may encounter GatewayNotReachable when trying to set credentials for a data source. This could be the result of an outdated Personal Gateway.  Install the latest gateway and try again.

## Processing Error: The following system error occurred: Type Mismatch  
This could be an issue with your M script within your Power BI Desktop file or Excel Workbook.  It could also be due to an out of date Power BI Desktop version.
