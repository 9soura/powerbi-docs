# Export (download) a Power BI service report for use in Power BI Desktop
In the **Power BI** service, you can easily export a report (also referred to as *downloading a report*) so you can open (and modify, if you want) the report in **Power BI Desktop**. The file extension used for **Power BI Desktop** files is *.pbix*. There are a few limitations and considerations to keep in mind, which are discussed later in this article.

To download the .pbix file, follow these steps:

1. In **Power BI**, open the report you want to download and select **File > Download report (Preview)**.

    > **Note:** The report must have been uploaded to the **Power BI service** November 24, 2016 - or updated since then - to be able to download the report. If it hasn't, the *Download Report* menu option in the **Power BI service** is grayed out.

2. While the report is being created, a status banner displays the progress (**1** in the image below). When the file is ready, the browser displays a download banner to let you decide what to do with the file (**2** in the image below). The name of the file matches the title of the report.

Once you download the file, you can open it in **Power BI Desktop** and work on it however you would like. There are a few different ways you can [get Power BI Desktop](powerbi-desktop-get-the-desktop.md).


## Limitations and Considerations

There are a few important considerations and limitations associated with downloading (exporting) a *.pbix* file from the **Power BI service**:

-   To download the file, you must have edit access to the report
-   The report must have originated from **Power BI Desktop**, either by being *published* to the **Power BI service** or by uploading a *.pbix* file to the service.
-   This feature will not work with reports originally created in the **Power BI service**, including content packs.
-   Reports must be published or updated after November 24, 2016. Reports published prior to then are not downloadable.
-   You should always be using the latest version of **Power BI Desktop** when opening downloaded files. Downloaded *.pbix* files may not open in non-current versions of **Power BI Desktop**.
-   If your administrator has turned off the ability to export data, this feature will not be visible in the **Power BI service**.
