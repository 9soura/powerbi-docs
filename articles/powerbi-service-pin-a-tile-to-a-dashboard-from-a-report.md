# Pin a tile to a Power BI dashboard from a report

﻿One way to add a new [dashboard tile](powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles.md) is from within a [Power BI report](powerbi-service-reports.md). In fact, you can add many new tiles from a report.  Each of these tiles, when clicked, is a link back into the report.

**NOTE**:  You can pin tiles from shared reports to a dashboard, but your changes aren't saved after you log out.

1.  [Get data](powerbi-service-get-data.md).

2.  Open a [report](powerbi-service-reports.md).

### Pin a tile from a report in Reading View

When you open a report that has one or more pages, it [opens in Reading View](powerbi-service-open-a-report-in-reading-view.md): you can interact with the visualizations and filters, but not edit the report. You can pin a tile from Reading View or from Editing View.

1.  Hover over the visualization you want to pin, and select the pin ![](media/powerbi-service-pin-a-tile-to-a-dashboard-from-a-report/PBI_PinTile_Small.png) icon.

2.  Pin the tile to an existing dashboard or to a new dashboard. 

    -   Existing dashboard: select the name of the dashboard from the dropdown.

    -   New dashboard: type the name of the new dashboard.

3.  Select **Pin**.

    A Success message (near the top right corner) lets you know the visualization was added, as a tile, to your dashboard.

4.  From the navigation pane, select the dashboard with the new tile. There, you can [rename, resize, link, and move](powerbi-service-edit-a-tile-in-a-dashboard.md) the pinned visualization.

### Pin a tile from Editing View

1.  Select **Edit Report** to open the report in Editing View.
