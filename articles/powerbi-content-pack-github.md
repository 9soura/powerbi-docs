# GitHub content pack for Power BI

The GitHub content pack for Power BI allows you to gain insights into a GitHub repository (also known as repo) with data around contributions, issues, pull requests and active users.

Connect to the [GitHub content pack](https://app.powerbi.com/getdata/services/github)for Power BI.

Creating this connection retrieves your data and automatically provides a dashboard and related reports based on the data.

**Requirements:**

-   The GitHub account that has access to the repo

-   Permission granted to the Power BI for GitHub app during first login

-    Sufficient API calls available to pull and refresh the data﻿
 

1.  Select **Get Data** at the bottom of the left navigation pane.

2.  In the **Services** box, select **Get**.

4.  Enter the repository name and repository owner of the repo.

    You can determine the owner and repository by looking at the repository in GitHub itself:

    ![](media/powerbi-content-pack-github/Github_OwnerRepo.png)

    The first part "Azure" is the owner and the second part "azure-sdk-for-php" is the repository itself.  You see these same two items in the URL of the repository:

    <https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-php> .

5.  Enter your GitHub credentials (this step might be skipped if you are already signed in with your browser). 

6.  For **Authentication Method**, select **oAuth2** \> **Sign In**. 

7.  Follow the Github authentication screens. Grant the GitHub for Power BI content pack permission to the GitHub data.

    This connects Power BI with GitHub and allows Power BI to connect to the data.  The data is refreshed once a day.

8.  After you connect to your GitHub repo, Power BI imports the data. You see a new dashboard, report, and dataset in the left navigation pane. New items are marked with a yellow asterisk \*.

## De-authorize Power BI
To de-authorize Power BI from being connected to your GitHub repo you can Revoke access in GitHub. For more details see this [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-ssh-keys-and-application-access-tokens-safe/#reviewing-your-authorized-applications-oauth) topic.

## Troubleshooting
If necessary, you can verify your GitHub credentials.
1. In another browser window, go to the GitHub web site and log in to GitHub. You can see you’re logged in, in the upper-right corner of the GitHub site.  
2. In GitHub, navigate to the URL of the repo you plan to access in Power BI. For example: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx.
3. Back in Power BI, try connecting to GitHub. In the Configure GitHub dialog box, use the names of the repo and repo owner for that same repo.
