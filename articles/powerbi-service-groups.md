# Groups in Power BI

[← Groups in Power BI](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/topics/101158-groups-in-power-bi)

Power BI groups offer a powerful collaborative experience built on Office 365 groups. Read more about [groups in Office 365](https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Find-help-about-Groups-in-Office-365-7a9b321f-b76a-4d53-b98b-a2b0b7946de1).

NOTE: Groups are only available with [Power BI Pro](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/685479).

Groups in Power BI bring you and your colleagues together to collaborate, communicate, and connect with your data across Office 365. Create a group in either Power BI or Office 365. Then invite co-workers into this group workspace where you can collaborate on your organization’s shared dashboards, reports, and datasets.  

Groups and [organizational content packs](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/651040) complement each other. When you create a content pack from within the group workspace, everyone in that group can edit the content pack.   

Collaboration doesn’t end with Power BI. It continues with other Office 365 group services, like sharing files on OneDrive for Business, conversations in Exchange, calendar, tasks, and so on.

You can also share dashboards, reports, and datasets read-only with people outside your group. The process is the same as [sharing dashboards in your own workspace.](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/431008)
