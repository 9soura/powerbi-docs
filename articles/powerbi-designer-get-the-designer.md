##With the designer, you can...

### Get data

The designer makes discovering data easy. You can import data from a wide variety of data sources. After you connect to a data source, you can shape the data to match your analysis and reporting needs.

### Create relationships

When you import two or more tables, oftentimes you'll need to create relationships between those tables. The designer includes the Manage Relationships dialog, where you can use Autodetect to let the designer find and create any relationships, or you can create them yourself. Learn more at [Create and manage relationships](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/464155-create-and-manage-relationships).

### Create reports

The designer includes the Report View. Select the fields you want, add filters, choose from dozens of visuals. Report View gives you the same great report and visual tools just like when creating a report on PowerBI.com. Learn more at [Report View in the Power BI Designer](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/461283-report-view-in-the-power-bi-designer).

### Save

With the designer, you can save your work as a Power BI file. Power BI files have a .pbix extension.
