# View SQL Server mobile reports and KPIs in the iPad app (Power BI for iOS)  

The iPad app for Microsoft Power BI for iOS offers live, touch-enabled mobile access to your important on-premises business information.

Create SQL Server mobile reports for your on-premises data with the SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher, and publish them to your Reporting Services web portal. You can also create KPIs, right on the web portal. Then view the mobile reports and KPIs on the iPad app for Power BI.
