First things first:

-  Create [Reporting Services mobile reports](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652547.aspx) with SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher and publish them to the [Reporting Services web portal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt637133.aspx). 
-  Create [KPIs on the Reporting Services web portal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt683632.aspx). Organize them in folders and mark your favorites, so you can find them easily. 

Then in the iPad app for Power BI, view the mobile reports and KPIs, organized in folders or collected as favorites. 

> [AZURE.NOTE]Â  Your iPad needs to be running at least iOS 8.0. 

## Explore samples without an SSRS server

Even if you don't have access to a Reporting Services web portal, you can still explore the features of Reporting Services mobile reports. 

-  Tap the global navigation button ![](media/powerbi-mobile-ipad-kpis-mobile-reports/power-bi-iphone-global-nav-button.png) in the upper-left corner, scroll down and tap **Reporting Services samples**.

2. Tap the server name you don't want to be connected to.
3. Tap **Remove Connection**.


## Create Reporting Services mobile reports and KPIs

You don't create Reporting Services KPIs and mobile reports in the Power BI mobile app. You create them in SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher and a SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services web portal.

- [Create your own Reporting Services mobile reports](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652547.aspx), and publish them to the Reporting Services web portal.
- Create [KPIs on the Reporting Services web portal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt683632.aspx)
