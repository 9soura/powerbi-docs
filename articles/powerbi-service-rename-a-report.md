# Rename a report in Power BI

Don't like the default name of a report in Power BI?  A new name is just a click away.  And renaming a report does not rename the associated dataset or [rename the associated dashboard](powerbi-service-rename-a-dashboard.md).

### To rename a report:

1.  In the navigation pane, right-click the report and select **Rename**.

2.  Type the new name.

### To rename a report that is part of an organizational content pack:

If the report is part of an [organizational content pack](powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-introduction.md), you will not see the Rename option.  To rename the report, you'll need to personalize it.

1.  In the navigation pane, right-click the report and select **Personalize \> Save**.
