# Arrange the Z-order of Report Elements

*Watch and learn how to control how your report elements overlap with each other with Z-order*

When you have lots of elements on a report, Power BI gives you a way to manage how they overlap with each other. Select an element and use the **Arrange** option on the Home tab to change its Z-order, including moving it one layer forward or backward, or sending it all the way to the front of the back of the order. This is particularly useful when using shapes as decorative backgrounds or borders.
