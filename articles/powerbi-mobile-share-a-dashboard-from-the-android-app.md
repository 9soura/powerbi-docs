# Share a dashboard from the Android app for Power BI

Invite colleagues to view your dashboards by sharing links from the [Android app for Microsoft Power BI](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/577773). You can only share dashboards with colleagues in the same email domain as you, and only if you have permissions to invite others.

## Share a dashboard

1.  In the upper-right corner of a dashboard, tap the Invite icon ![](media/powerbi-mobile-share-a-dashboard-from-the-android-app/PBI_Andr_InviteIcon.png).

    Or, on the dashboards home page, tap the ellipsis (...) and tap **Invite a colleague**.

    If you're the owner of the dashboard, you see the list of colleagues with whom you've shared this dashboard, with these notes:

    -   **Pending**: They haven't yet accepted the invitation to view the dashboard.

    -   **Can View**: They have viewed the dashboard but can't share it.

    -   **Can View & Invite**: They have viewed the dashboard and can share it with other colleagues.

2.  Type email addresses, and a message to accompany your dashboard invitation. Otherwise Power BI sends a default message.

3.  To allow resharing, leave **Allow recipients to share your dashboard** selected.

    >**Note**:  Resharing allows your coworkers to forward the email invitation to others in your organization, either through the browser or the mobile apps.

4.  Tap **Done**, then tap the paper airplane icon ![](media/powerbi-mobile-share-a-dashboard-from-the-android-app/PBI_Andr_SendPlane.png) in the upper-right corner to send the mail.

    Your colleagues get an email invitation with a direct link to the dashboard. The invitation expires after one month. When they open it in a browser or in one of the mobile apps, it's added to their Power BI account.

## Unshare a dashboard

You can only unshare a dashboard if you're the dashboard owner.

1.  In the upper-right corner of your dashboard, tap the Invite icon ![](media/powerbi-mobile-share-a-dashboard-from-the-android-app/PBI_Andr_InviteIcon.png). 

    You see the list of colleagues with whom you've shared this dashboard.

2.   To stop sharing the dashboard with a colleague, tap the X next to a name \> **Remove**.



## Notes about sharing dashboards

You and your colleagues see the same data in the dashboard. Thus, if you have permissions to see more data than they do, they'll be able to see all your data in your dashboard.

-   If your colleagues haven't signed up for Power BI yet, they need to do so to see your dashboard.

-   You can only share dashboards with colleagues in the same email domain as you. For example, if your email address is nancy@contoso.com, you can share with bill@contoso.com but not with joe@ca.contoso.com or sally@fabrikam.com.

-   Your colleagues can see your dashboard and even see the changes you make in the Power BI service online, after you save those changes.

-   You can share snapshots of tiles with anyone, in or out of your email domain.
