# Use Custom Visuals With the Visuals Gallery

*Discover how to download and use custom visuals in your own reports and dashboards*

In previous articles you have seen how you can use the Power BI custom visualization framework to build your own visualizations and use them in reports. Since opening that framework, there as been a huge groundswell of people creating their own unique and informative visuals and submitting them to our Visuals Gallery.

To use or add your own custom visual, first open the [Visuals Gallery](https://app.powerbi.com/visuals "Power BI Visuals Gallery") in your browser. This gallery contains the whole range of visuals that people have created, with everything from bullet charts and waffle charts to stylized visuals like using fish shapes to represent aquarium data.

Choose the visual that you'd like to use, and select **Download Visual**. Review and agree to the usage license. The visual will be downloaded as a .pbiviz file.

Now open Power BI Desktop. Select the **Import from file** ellipses menu at the end of the visual list in the Visualizations pane, and use the file browser to locate the downloaded visual file. A button for the new visual will appear in the Visualizations pane with the other default visuals. You can use it just like any other visual, by clicking the visual button and dragging the appropriate fields to its buckets. Other visuals and slicers on the same report page will interact with the custom visual as expected.
