# Clean and Transform Your Data With the Query Editor

[![Basic transformations](http://img.youtube.com/vi/o-sinon5JYY/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-sinon5JYY)

*See how the Query Editor tools can get your data ready for modelling*

The Power BI Desktop Query Editor is a powerful tool for cleaning and transforming data so it's ready for your models and visualizations.

On the left side of the Query Editor screen is a list of your imported tables. In the center of the screen is a preview of the data contained by the selected table. On the right side of the Query Editor is the name of the selected table (you can rename it here) and a history of applied transformations.

Right-clicking on a column displays a number of different available transformations, such as removing the column from the table, duplicating the column under a new name, and replacing values. From this menu you can also split text columns into multiples by common delimiters.

The Query Editor ribbon contains additional tools, such as changing the data type of columns, adding scientific notation, or extracting elements from dates such as day of the week.

As you apply transformations, your steps will appear in the **Applied Steps** list on the left. You can use this list to undo or review specific changes. To save your transformations, select **Close & Apply** on the Home tab.
