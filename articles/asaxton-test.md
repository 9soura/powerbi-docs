# Unsupported data source for refresh

You may see an error when trying to configure a dataset for **Scheduled Refresh**.

    You cannot schedule refresh for this dataset because it gets data from sources that currently don't support refresh.

This happens when the data source you used, within **Power BI Desktop**, isn't supported for refresh.  You can see the list of supported data sources at [Refresh data in Power BI](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/474669-refresh-data).
