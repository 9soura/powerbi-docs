# What can developers do with Power BI?

Power BI displays dashboards that are interactive, and can be created and updated from many different data sources in real time. Using any programming language that supports REST calls, you can create apps that integrate with a Power BI dashboard in real-time. You can also integrate Power BI tiles and reports into apps.

Developers can also build their own data visualizations that can be used in interactive reports and dashboards. 

Here are some of the things you can do with the Power BI APIs.

|**To do this**| **Go here**

### Other things you can do to learn about the developing for Power BI

- **Check out the Power BI projects on GitHub and our samples** - GitHub has many Power BI projects: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Power+BI) and search “Power BI”. Or, we have these samples:
	- [Client app sample](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt186159.aspx): A console app that shows you how to authenticate a client app and call all Power BI operations.
	- [Web app sample](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt186158.aspx): A web app that shows you how to authenticate a Power BI web app.
  - [Integrate a Power BI tile into an app](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt576402.aspx): A web app that shows you how to integrate a Power BI tile into an app.
  - [Integrate a Power BI report into an app](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt631357.aspx): A web app that shows you how to integrate a Power BI report into an app.

- [**Try the Power BI REST API**](http://docs.powerbi.apiary.io/) -
In the Apiary interactive API console, you can try all Power BI REST API operations such as [Create Dataset](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt203562.aspx) and [Get Datasets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt203567.aspx).
