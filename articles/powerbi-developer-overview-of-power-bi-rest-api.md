# Overview of Power BI REST API

Power BI displays dashboards that are interactive, and can be created and updated from many different data sources in real time.

## What can I do with the Power BI API?

Using any programming language that supports REST calls, you can create apps that integrate with a Power BI dashboard in real-time. You can also integrate Power BI tiles and reports into apps.

Here are some of the things you can do with the Power BI API.
