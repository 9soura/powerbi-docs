# Get started with the Power BI app for iOS on an iPhone or iPod Touch

The Microsoft Power BI for iOS app, on the iPhone or iPod Touch, is part of the mobile BI experience for Power BI and Reporting Services. With live, touch-enabled mobile access to your important business information on premises and in the cloud, you can view and interact with your company dashboards easily, from anywhere. Explore the data in dashboards, and share them with your colleagues in email or text messages. And keep up to date with your most timely data on your [Apple Watch](powerbi-mobile-apple-watch.md).

You can [create dashboards and reports in the Power BI service](powerbi-service-get-started.md) with your own data, or connect to existing [content packs for a variety of services](powerbi-content-packs-services.md). Then interact with your dashboards, explore the data, and share them, all from the iPhone app for Power BI.

You can also [view Reporting Services KPIs and mobile reports for your on-premises data](powerbi-mobile-ipad-kpis-mobile-reports.md) in the iPhone app for Power BI. You [create those KPIs and mobile reports with the SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652547.aspx).
