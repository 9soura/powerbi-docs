# Get started with the iPhone app (Power BI for iOS)

The iPhone app for Microsoft Power BI for iOS is part of the mobile BI experience for Power BI and Reporting Services. With live, touch-enabled mobile access to your important business information on premises and in the cloud, you can view and interact with your company dashboards easily, from anywhere. Explore the data in dashboards, and share them with your colleagues in email or text messages.  

>**Note**: Coming in December 2015, you'll also be able to view and interact with your SQL Server KPIs and mobile reports in the Power BI app.

Maybe a colleague sent you a link to a Power BI dashboard? Now you can view it on your iPhone.

You can [create dashboards and reports in the Power BI service](powerbi-service-get-started.md) with your own data. Then interact with your dashboards, explore the data, and share them, all from the iPhone app for Power BI.

You can also [view SQL Server KPIs and mobile reports for your on-premises data](powerbi-mobile-ipad-kpis-mobile-reports.md) in the iPhone app for Power BI. You [create those KPIs and mobile reports with the SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652547.aspx).

    >Tip: When you're in the app, tap the options icon ![](media/powerbi-mobile-iphone-app-get-started/PBI_iPad_OptionsIcon.png) in the upper-left corner to go between the two. 

## Start with samples

Even without signing up, you can play with the Power BI samples. After you download the app you can view the samples or get started. Go back to the samples whenever you want from the dashboards home page.
