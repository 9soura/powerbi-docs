# Purchasing Power BI Pro  

You can purchase Power BI Pro directly through the Power BI website or through your Microsoft representative or partner.

To purchase directly through the Power BI website, follow these steps:

1.  Go to https://app.powerbi.com.

2.  Click the App Launcher in the top-left corner of the screen, then click the Admin tile.  If you don't see the Admin tile, this means you are not an administrator for your organization.  You must contact the administrator to purchase Power BI Pro.

3.  If you are taken to the Office 365 Admin Center like the screenshot below, skip to step 5.
