# Upload Excel Data to Power BI Service

*Discover how easy it is to upload an Excel spreadsheet to the Power BI service*

The simplest way of using Excel with the Power BI service is to just take a standard Excel spreadsheet and upload it.

Before you upload, ensure that your Excel workbook has been formatted appropriately. Check that the data you want to use has been noted as a table using **Table** from the Insert tab within Excel. Save your document one final time before uploading.

Return to the Power BI service and select **Get Data**. Choose **Files** under Import or Connect to Data. You can select the location of your data, either Local File, OneDrive - Personal, or OneDrive - Business. Once the Excel file has been uploaded, it will appear under Datasets in the Power BI service homepage.

When you click on the new dataset, your Excel columns will appear as fields in the Fields pane, and you can use them to build reports as like  any other data.
