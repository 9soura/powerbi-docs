# Samples for Power BI service

## About the samples

Want to try the Power BI service with industry-specific sample data?  

>**NOTE**: These samples are for use in the Power BI service...not Power BI Desktop.

Microsoft has created sample content for you to use with Power BI. Each of these samples is available as a **content pack** and as a separate Excel workbook. A *content pack* is a type of sample where the dataset is bundled with a dashboard and/or report. The sample content packs are available from within Power BI service, using **Get Data**.   

The Excel workbooks that were used to create the content packs can be downloaded [as a zip file](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=535020) or [individually](powerbi-sample-downloads.md). Advanced users may want to download the Excel workbooks to explore or edit the data models.

## Available samples

The following samples are available for the Power BI service. The samples use real data from
obviEnce ([www.obvience.com](http://www.obvience.com/)) that has been anonymized.
