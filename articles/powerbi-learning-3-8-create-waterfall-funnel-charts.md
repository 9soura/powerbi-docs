# How to Use Waterfall and Funnel Charts

*Watch and learn how to create and customize waterfall and funnel charts*

Along with more standard options, Power BI also supports some more unusual visualizations such as funnel charts and waterfalls.

Waterfall charts are typically used to show changes in a particular value over time. Funnel charts are typically used to show changes over a particular process, such as a sales pipeline or website retention efforts.

To create a blank chart, select it from the Visualizations pane. Waterfalls only have two bucket options: Category and Y Axis. Drag a time-based field such as year to the Category bucket, and the value you want to track to the Y Axis bucket. Time periods where there was an increase in value are displayed in green by default, while periods with a decrease in value are displayed in red. Both Waterfall and Funnel charts can be sliced and visually customized.
