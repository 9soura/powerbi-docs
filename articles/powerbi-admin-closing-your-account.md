# Closing your Power BI Account

If you don't want to use Power BI any longer, you can ask us to close your Power BI account.  After your account is closed, you can no longer sign in to Power BI.  Also, any customer data you uploaded, or created, in Power BI is deleted according to the data retention policy in the Power BI Terms of Service.

If you have a free account, or are paying for the individual Power BI Pro subscription, you can contact support to request an account closure.
