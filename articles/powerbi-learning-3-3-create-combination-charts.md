# How to Use Combination Charts

*Watch how to create and customize a combination chart*

When you want to visualize two measures that have very different scales, such as revenue and units, a combination chart that shows a line and a bar with different axis scales is very useful. Power BI supports a number of different types of combination charts by default, including the popular Line and Stacked Columns Chart.

When you create a combination chart you'll be presented with a field for Shared Axis (the X-axis), and then values for your two fields, in this case a column and a line. The two Y-axis legends will appear on either side of the visualization.

Combination charts are an effective way to visualize multiple measures that have very different scales in a single visualization.
