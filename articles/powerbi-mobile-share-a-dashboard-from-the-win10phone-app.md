# Share a dashboard from the Windows 10 phone app for Power BI

Invite colleagues to view your dashboards by sharing links from the [Windows 10 phone app for Microsoft Power BI](powerbi-mobile-win10phone-app-get-started.md). You can only share dashboards with colleagues in the same email domain as you, and only if you have permissions to invite others.

## Share a dashboard

1.  In the bottom-right corner of a dashboard, tap the Invite icon ![](media/powerbi-mobile-share-a-dashboard-from-the-win10phone-app/PBI_Andr_InviteIcon.png).

    Or, on the dashboards home page, press and hold, and tap **Invite**.

    If you're the owner of the dashboard, you see the list of colleagues with whom you've shared this dashboard, with these notes:

    -   **Pending**: They haven't yet accepted the invitation to view the dashboard.

    -   **Read only**: They have viewed the dashboard but can't share it.

    -   **Read and reshare**: They have viewed the dashboard and can share it with other colleagues.

2.  Type email addresses, and a message to accompany your dashboard invitation. Otherwise Power BI sends a default message.

3.  To allow resharing, leave **Allow recipients to share your dashboard** selected.

    >**Note**:  Resharing allows your coworkers to share this dashboard with others in your organization, either through the browser or the mobile apps.

4.  Tap the Send icon ![](media/powerbi-mobile-share-a-dashboard-from-the-win10phone-app/PBI_Win10Ph_SendIcon.png).

    The dashboard is automatically added to your colleagues' Power BI account, and they get an email invitation with a direct link to the dashboard.


## Notes about sharing dashboards

You and your colleagues see the same data in the dashboard. Thus, if you have permissions to see more data than they do, they'll be able to see all your data in your dashboard.

-   If your colleagues haven't signed up for Power BI yet, they need to do so to see your dashboard.

-   You can share snapshots of tiles with anyone, in or out of your email domain.
