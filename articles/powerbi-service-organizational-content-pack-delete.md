# Delete your connection to an organizational content pack in Power BI 

A coworker created a content pack. You discovered it in the content pack library and added it to your Power BI workspace. Now you don't need it any longer.  How do you remove it?

To delete a content pack, delete its dataset.  

-   In the left Navigation pane, select the ellipsis to the right of the dataset and select **Delete \> Yes**.

Deleting the dataset removes all associated reports and dashboards.

>**Notes:**  
>
> - Deleting your connection to the content pack doesn't delete the content pack from your organization's content pack library.  Remember, you can always return to the content gallery and add the content pack back to your workspace. 
> -  If you create a content pack, you (and only you) can [delete it from the content pack library](powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-manage-update-delete.md).
