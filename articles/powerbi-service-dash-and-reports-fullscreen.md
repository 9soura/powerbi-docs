# Display dashboards and reports in Full Sceen mode

Display your dashboards and reports without the distraction of menus and navigation buttons.  You get an unadulterated, full view of your business at a glance, all the time. This is also referred to as TV mode.

Some uses for Full Screen mode are:

- presenting your dashboards and reports at a meeting or conference
- displaying your dashboard in an office on a dedicated large screen or projector
- looking at your dashboards and reports on a small screen
- reviewing your dashboards and reports in locked mode -- you can touch the screen or mouse over tiles without opening the underlying report

>**NOTE**:
>Tiles can also be viewed in full screen mode (aka In-focus mode).

##To turn Full Screen on (and off)
1. From your dashboard or report, select the **Full Screen** icon.

2. Your dashboard or report page fills the entire screen.

3. Sometimes dashboards will display in Full Screen mode with scrollbars (see above). To remove scrollbars, in the upper right corner, select the **Fit to Screen** icon.
