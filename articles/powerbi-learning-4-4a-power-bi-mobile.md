# Introducing Power BI Mobile

*See how the Power BI app lets you keep track of your data from anywhere*

If you want to keep track of your data while you're on the move, you can use one of Power BI's mobile applications for iOS, Android, and Windows devices.

When using the Power BI app, first log in to your account using your Power BI service account information. The first screen that you'll see displays all of the content to which you have access, including reports, dashboards, and groups. There are also sample dashboards that you can use to get inspired or just show off Power BI's capabilities. The app is designed to be touch-friendly: tap on a dashboard or report to view it full-screen and scroll through them using your finger.

Tap on a dashboard tile to focus on it in a larger view. You can also annotate any insights that you discover by tapping the **Annotate** button in the top left-hand corner. This allows you to draw on a focused tile to highlight particular areas of interest. Share your annotated tile by tapping the **Share** link in the top right-hand corner.

Tap the **Report** link in the top right-hand corner to view the underlying report for a tile. This will display the exact same visualizations that you would see in a web browser or in Power BI Desktop.
