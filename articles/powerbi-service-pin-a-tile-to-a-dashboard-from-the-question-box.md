# Pin a tile to a Power BI dashboard from the Q&A question box

[← All about dashboards](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/topics/65158-all-about-dashboards)

Q&A is the Power BI ad hoc reporting tool. Need to find a particular insight? Ask a question about your data, and receive an answer in the form of a visualization.

1.  Create a [dashboard](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/424868-dashboards-in-power-bi) and [get data](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/434354-connect-to-a-data-source).
    
2.  In the question box at the top of your dashboard, start typing what you want to know about your data.

3.  For example, as you type "2014 sales by month and territory"...

    the question box restates your question as "Show fiscal month, territory, and number of sales, where fiscal year is in 2014".
    
4.  To add the chart to your dashboard as a tile, click the pin in the upper-right corner of the chart.

5.  Optionally, [rename, resize, and reposition the tile](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/424878) on your dashboard.

## Tips for using Q&A

-   When you start typing a question, Q&A immediately begins searching for the best answer from all datasets associated with the current dashboard.  The "current dashboard" is the dashboard highlighted in the navigation pane.
-   **How does Q&A know which datasets to use**?  Q&A has access to all datasets that have visualizations pinned to that dashboard.
