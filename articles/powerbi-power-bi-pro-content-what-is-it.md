# Power BI Pro content - what is it?

[← Getting started](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/topics/63037-getting-started)

**Power BI Pro content** is a dashboard, report, or dataset that uses a connection or other functionality (such as hourly refresh) that is only available with a Power BI Pro license.

If you have a Power BI Pro license, you can create content using features that are only available to users with a Power BI Pro license, and when you do, a Power BI Pro license is needed to *interact with or consume* that Power BI Pro content.

If your content contains any of the following items, it's Power BI Pro content:

-   Data from a direct query dataset, such as [SQL Server Analysis Services](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/471633) tabular data, [Azure SQL Database](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/581421), [Azure SQL Data Warehouse](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/636088), or Apache [Spark for HDInsight](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/654094).

-   Data from a [dataset that refreshes more frequently than daily](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/474669).

-   Data from a dataset that connects to on-premises data using the Power BI [Personal Gateway](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/649846) or Power BI [Data Management Gateway](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/497354).

-   A dashboard or report that's installed from an [organizational content pack](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/651040).

-   A dashboard, report, or dataset that's contained in a [group workspace](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/654247).

For example, if you create a manufacturing dashboard that updates progress multiple times during the day, anyone *consuming* that dashboard would need a Power BI Pro license. Or, if you create a report using the Power BI AS Connector, then another that uses Personal Gateway, anyone *consuming or interacting* with either of those reports would need a Power BI Pro license.

If you want to share your Power BI Pro content with users, they can sign up for a [free trial of Power BI Pro](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/664495), and gain access to your content during the trial period.

For a list of Power BI Pro features (and how those features compare to a free Power BI license), take a look at [Power BI Pricing](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing).
