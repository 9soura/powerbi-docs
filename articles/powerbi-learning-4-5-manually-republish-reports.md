# Manually Republishing and Refreshing Your Data

*See how to manually republish your dataset and report to the Power BI service*

When you select **Publish** in Power BI Desktop for a report that already exists in the service, you'll be prompted to confirm that you want to replace the previous dataset with this edited one. This will update the datasets and reports in the Power BI service.

This is a way to manually refresh your data.
