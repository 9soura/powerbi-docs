# SQL Sentry content pack for Power BI

﻿Analyzing your performance data collected by SQL Sentry is easy with Power BI. Power BI retrieves your data, then builds a default dashboard and related reports based on that data.

**Requirements:**

-   The SQL Sentry account you use for connecting to http://cloud.sqlsentry.com. 
-   A Database ID you will monitor.  Instructions for where to find the Database ID are below.

Connect to the [SQL Sentry content pack](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/getdata/services/sql-sentry) for Power BI.

After you have created the connection, you can explore your data and customize the dashboard to meet your needs. Data is automatically refreshed every day.

1.  Select **Get Data** at the bottom of the left navigation pane.
