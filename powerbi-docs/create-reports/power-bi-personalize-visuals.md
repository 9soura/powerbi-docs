# Let users personalize visuals in a report

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../includes/applies-to.md)] [!INCLUDE [yes-desktop](../includes/yes-desktop.md)] [!INCLUDE [yes-service](../includes/yes-service.md)]

When you share a report with a broad audience, some of your users may want to see slightly different views of particular visuals. Maybe they'd want to swap what's on the axis, change the visual type, or add something to the tooltip. It's hard to make one visual that satisfies everyone's requirements. With this new capability, you can empower your end-users to explore and personalize visuals, all in report reading view. They can adjust the visual the way they want, and save it as a bookmark to come back to. They don't need to have edit permission for the report, or to go back to the report author for a change.
 
## Feature overview

This feature allows end-users to gain further insights through ad-hoc exploration of visuals on a Power BI report. 
The personalizing visuals feature is ideal for report creators who want enable basic exploration scenarios their report readers. Here are modifications report readers can make:

- Change the visualization type
- Swap out a measure or dimension
- Add or remove a legend
- Compare two or more measures
- Change aggregations, etc.
Not only does this feature allow for new exploration capabilities, but it also includes ways for end-users to capture, share, and revert their changes:
- Capture their changes
- Share their changes
- Reset all their changes to a report
- Reset all their changes to a visual
- Clear out their recent changes
Setup experience
Since this feature is in preview, you will need to first turn on the feature switch by going to File > Options and Settings > Options > Preview feature and make sure Personalize visuals is turned on:
 
After you turn on the preview switch, you will need to specifically enable it for the reports that you want end-users to be able to personalize visuals for.
You can enable the feature either in Power BI Desktop or Power BI Service.
If you want to enable the feature from Power BI Desktop, you will need to go to File > Options and Settings > Options > Report settings for the current file and make sure Personalize visuals (preview) is turned on.
 
If you prefer to enable to enable the feature from Power BI Service instead of Power BI Desktop, go to the report settings of your report:

 
Then, you will need to toggle-on the setting for Personalize visuals (preview) and hit save:
 
When you enable this setting for a given report, all visuals in that report will have this experience on by default. If you want to customize which visuals have this experience, you can toggle on/off this setting per visual in the visual header section of the formatting pane:
 

Consumption experience (Power BI Service â€“ reading mode)
Using this feature, your end-users can explore a visual in many ways! Check out the examples below to see different ways users can tweak a visualization to meet their needs. 
Change the visualization type
Users can view the visualization in a different representation by simply changing the Visualization type.
 
Swap out a measure or dimension
Users can replace a measure or dimension by selecting the field that they want to replace and then selecting another measure or dimension.
 
Add or remove a legend
By adding a legend, users can color-code a visual based on a category, or by removing the legend through the context menu, they can eliminate the categorical color-coding. 
 
Compare two or more different measures
By adding multiple measures for a visual using the + icon, they can compare and contrast how the different measures behave.
  

Change aggregations
If users want to change how a measure is computed, they can change the aggregation (for an implicit measure) through the context menu.
 
Capture their changes 
Using personal bookmarks, users can capture their changes so that they can return to their personalized view. 
 
Additionally, they have the option to make the bookmark their default view.
Share their changes 
For your end-users that have read and reshare permissions, when they share the report, they can choose to include their changes.

 
Reset all their changes to a report
Using reset to default, users can reset all their changes in the report back to the authors last saved view of the report.
 
Reset all their changes to a visual
Using reset this visual, users can reset their changes to a particular visual so that that visual reflects the authors last saved view for that visual.
 
Clear out their recent changes
Using the eraser icon, users can clear any of the recent changes they've made starting from point when they opened the flyout.  
 

## Limitations and known issues

At the current state of the feature, there are a few limitations to be aware of.

- This feature is not supported for embed scenarios, including publish to web.
- User explorations don't automatically persist. They need to save their view as a personal bookmark to capture their changes.
- Users can't make change visuals while in the Power BI mobile apps. However, any visual changes they save in a personal bookmark while in the Power BI service are respected in the mobile apps.

There are some known issues that we're in the process of addressing:

- Adding hierarchy is not supported; users will need to add the individual child items.
- Users can't change a date hierarchy to a date and vice-versa. 
- With Personal bookmarks, users might get results that are slightly different based on the sequence they select. This is due to the fact that we don't capture the full state of the report just the modifications made; the workaround is to hit reset to default and then selecting the bookmark you want to view. 

## Next steps
