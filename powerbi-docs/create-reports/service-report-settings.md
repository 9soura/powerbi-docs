# Change report settings in the Power BI service

If you have permission to edit a report in the Power BI service, you can change a number of settings that control how your report readers experience the report. For example, you can allow them to save filters for the report, or display the report pages as tabs across the bottom of the report instead of along the side. Let's get started!

It might be helpful to read these articles first:

- [Create a report in the Power BI service by importing a dataset](service-report-create-new.md), to understand the report creation experience.
- [Reports in Power BI](../consumer/end-user-reports.md), to understand the report readers' experience.

## Prerequisites
- [Sign up for the Power BI service](../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md). For creating reports using Power BI Desktop, see [Desktop report view](desktop-report-view.md).
- If you don't already have a report in the Power BI service, you can [install a sample content pack](sample-datasets.md#install-built-in-content-packs) containing a dashboard, report, and dataset. 

## Open the report Settings pane

1. In report Reading view, select **File** > **Settings**.
1. In the **Settings** pane, you see a number of toggles you can set, just for this report. The rest of this article calls out some of them.

## Featured

The report appears on your Power BI Home page.

## Pages pane

When you toggle **Pages pane** on, report readers see the report page tabs along the bottom of the report in Reading view, instead of along the side. The report page tabs are already along the bottom of the report in Edit view.

## Personalize visuals (preview)

You can allow your readers to change the visuals in your report. Read more about [letting users personalize visuals](power-bi-personalize-visuals.md).
