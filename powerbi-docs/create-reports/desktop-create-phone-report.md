# Optimize Power BI reports for the mobile app
You can improve the experience of viewing reports in the mobile apps by creating a mobile-optimized version of the report.

Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service provide a mobile layout view where you can choose, rearrange, and resize report visuals for an optimal experience on a mobile device.

The mobile layout view provides
* A phone emulator with a long canvas with a fine-grained grid. This makes it possible to include many visuals, and to scale and shape them finely. A fine-grained grid gives you more flexibility in resizing and placing visuals, and a longer canvas allows you to add more visuals to your page.
* A visualization pane that shows the name of each visual and its visibility status. Now, you can find your desired visual by looking for its name, and you can also easily differentiate between hidden and shown visuals.
* The ability to overlay visuals one on top of another. This lets you use the same design techniques used in the web layout for building interactive reports using bookmarks. You can also create attractive reports by layering visuals over images.

You can create responsive visuals and responsive slicers that resize anywhere. If you add filters to your report, they show up automatically in the optimized report.

## Create a mobile-optimized portrait version of a report page

The first step is to create the report in the regular web view. After you've created the report, you can optimize it for phones and tablets.

To create the mobile-optimized view:

1. Open the mobile layout
   * In Power BI Desktop, select the **View** ribbon and choose **Mobile layout**.
   * In the Power BI service, select **Edit report > Mobile Layout**.

   You see a scrollable, fine-grained canvas shaped like a phone, and a **Visualizations** pane that lists all of the visuals that are on the original report page.

1. To add a visual to the mobile layout, drag it from the **Visualizations** pane to the phone canvas. When you drag the visual to the canvas, it snaps to the grid.

   You can add some or all the master report page visuals to the mobile-optimized report page. You can add each visual only once, and you don't have to include all the visuals.

1. You can resize your visuals on the grid by dragging the handles that appear around the edge of the visual when you select it. The phone report grid scales across phones of different sizes, so your report looks good on small- and large-screen phones.

### Removing visuals
To remove a visual from the mobile layout, click the **X** in the top-right corner of the visual on the phone canvas, or select the visual and press **Delete**.

You can remove all the visualizations from the canvas by clicking the eraser on the **Visualization** pane.

Removing visuals from the mobile layout canvas removes them from the canvas only. The visuals still appear in the visualization pane, and the original report remains unaffected.

## Optimize a visual for any size

By default, visuals in your report or dashboard are responsive. That is, they change dynamically to display the maximum amount of data and insight, no matter the screen size.

As a visual changes size, Power BI gives priority to the data. For example, it might remove padding and move the legend to the top of the visual automatically so that the visual remains informative even as it gets smaller.

If for some reason you want to turn responsiveness off, you can do that in the [format settings of the visual](). Read more about [optimizing visuals]().

## Enhance slicers to work well in mobile-optimized reports

Slicers offer on-canvas filtering of report data. When designing slicers in the regular report authoring mode, you can modify some slicer settings to make them more usable in mobile-optimized reports:
* You can decide whether to allow report readers to select only one item or multiple items.
* It is recommended to put a box around the slicer to make the report easier to scan.
* You can make the slicer vertical, horizontal, or responsive (responsive slicers must be horizontal).

If you make the slicer responsive, as you change its size and shape it shows more or fewer options. It can be tall, short, wide, or narrow. If you make it small enough, it becomes just a filter icon on the report page.

## Remove visuals from the mobile layout

To remove a visual from the mobile layout, click the **X** in the top-right corner of the visual on the phone canvas, or select the visual and press **Delete**.

You can remove all the visualizations from the canvas by clicking the eraser on the **Visualization** pane.

Removing visuals from the mobile layout canvas removes them from the canvas only. The visuals still appear in the visualization pane, and the original report remains unaffected.

## Considerations when creating mobile-optimized layouts
* For reports with multiple pages, you can optimize all the pages or just a few.
* If you've defined a background color for a report page, the mobile-optimized report will have the same background color.
* You can't modify format settings just for the mobile-optimized report. Formatting is consistent between the master and mobile layouts. For example, the font sizes will be the same.
* To change a visual, such as changing its formatting, dataset, filters, or any other attribute, return to the regular report authoring mode.

## Publish a mobile-optimized report
To publish a mobile-optimized version of a report, [publish the main report from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI service](desktop-upload-desktop-files.md). This publishes the mobile-optimized version at the same time.

## Viewing optimized and unoptimized reports on a phone or tablet

The Power BI mobile apps on phones automatically detect whether the report is mobile-optimized or not.
* If a mobile-optimized report exists, the app automatically opens the report in mobile-optimized mode.
* If a mobile-optimized report doesnâ€™t exist, the report opens in the unoptimized, landscape view.

Holding a phone in landscape orientation opens the report in the unoptimized view with the original report layout, regardless of whether the report is optimized or not. If you optimize only some pages, readers see a message in portrait view, indicating that the report is available in landscape.

Report readers can turn their phones or tablets sideways to see the page in landscape mode. Read more about interacting with Power BI reports optimized for portrait mode.
