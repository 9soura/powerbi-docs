# What are paginated reports in Power BI Premium? (Preview)

Paginated reports are reports designed to be printed or shared. They're called "paginated" because they're formatted to fit well on a page, and display all the data in a table, for example, even if the table spans multiple pages. They're sometimes called "pixel perfect" because you can control their report page layout exactly. Paginated reports are based on the RDL report technology in SQL Server Reporting Services. 

This article answers many of the most common questions people have about paginated reports in Power BI Premium, and about Report Builder, the standalone tool for authoring paginated reports. You need a Power BI Pro license to publish a report to the service. You can publish and share paginated reports in your My Workspace or in app workspaces, as long as the workspace is in a Power BI Premium capacity.
