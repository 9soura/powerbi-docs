# Interact with a report in Editing View in Power BI
In report [Editing view](service-reading-view-and-editing-view.md), you have lots of flexibility in exploring and designing a report. All the [Reading view](service-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view.md) functionality is available -- plus lots more. Editing view is only available to the person who created the report or to colleagues who [co-own a report as a member or admin of an app workspace](service-create-distribute-apps.md).

## Functionality only available in Editing view
Take a look at the list of topics under the **Reports** header in the Table of Contents to the left. It's a long list and many of the topics cover functionality *only available if you have editing permissions for a report*.  To help you navigate the Table of Contents, Editing view is required for the following:

* Creating, editing, renaming, sharing, and deleting reports.
* Adding, renaming, rearranging, and deleting report pages.
* Formatting reports.
* Adding visualizations, text boxes, and shapes to a report.
* Adding visual-level, page-level, and report-level filters and setting visual interactions.
* Creating refresh schedules.
* Q&A - asking questions in reports
* Showing data used to create the visualization 
* Setting up drillthrough
* Duplicating a report page
