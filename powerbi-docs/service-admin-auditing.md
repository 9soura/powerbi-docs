# Using auditing within your organization

Learn how you can use auditing with Power BI to monitor and investigate actions taken. You can use the Security and Compliance Center or use PowerShell.

Knowing who is taking what action on which item in your Power BI tenant can be critical in helping your organization fulfill its requirements, such as meeting regulatory compliance and records management. You can use Power BI auditing to audit actions performed by users, such as "View Report" and "View Dashboard". You cannot use auditing to audit permissions. 

You can filter the audit data by date range, user, dashboard, report, dataset and activity type. You can also download the activities in a csv (comma separated value) file to analyze offline.

## Requirements
You must meet these requirements to access audit logs:

- To access the auditing section of the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, you must have an Exchange Online license (included with Office 365 Enterprise E3 and E5 subscriptions).

- You must either be a global admin or have an Exchange admin role that provides access to the audit log. Exchange admin roles are controlled through the Exchange admin center. For more information, see [Permissions in Exchange Online](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj200692(v=exchg.150).aspx).

- If you have access to the audit log but are not a global admin or Power BI Service admin, you will not have access to the Power BI Admin portal. In this case, you must get a direct link to the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center.

- To view audit logs for Power BI in your tenant, you need at least one exchange mailbox license in your tenant.

## Accessing your audit logs

To audit your Power BI logs, visit the O365 Security & Compliance Center.

There can be up to a 48 hour delay between enabling auditing and being able to view audit data. If you don't see data immediately, check the audit logs later. There can be a similar delay between getting permission to view audit logs and being able to access the logs.

1. Select the **gear icon** in the upper right.

2. Select **Admin Portal**.
   
   ![](media/service-admin-auditing/powerbi-admin.png)

3. Select **Audit logs**.
 
4. Select **Go to O365 Admin Center**.
   
   ![](media/service-admin-auditing/audit-log-o365-admin-center.png)

Alternatively, you can browse to [Office 365 | Security & Compliance](https://protection.office.com/#/unifiedauditlog).

To provide non-administrator accounts with access to the audit log, you will need to assign permissions within the Exchange Online Admin Center. For example, you could assign a user to an existing role group, such as Organization Management, or you could create a new role group with the Audit Logs role. For more information, see [Permissions in Exchange Online](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj200692\(v=exchg.150\).aspx).

## Search only Power BI activities

You can restrict results to only Power BI activities by doing the following.

1. On the **Audit log search** page, select the drop down for **Activities** under **Search**.

2. Select **PowerBI activities**.
   
   ![](media/service-admin-auditing/audit-log-search-filter-by-powerbi.png)

3. Select anywhere outside of the selection box to close it.

Your searches will now be filtered to only Power BI activities.

## Search the audit logs by date

You can search the logs by date range using the “Start date” and “End date” field. The last seven days are selected by default. The date and time are presented in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. The maximum date range that you can specify is 90 days. An error is displayed if the selected date range is greater than 90 days.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using the maximum date range of 90 days, select the current time for the Start date. Otherwise, you'll receive an error saying that the start date is earlier than the end date. If you've turned on auditing within the last 90 days, the maximum date range can't start before the date that auditing was turned on.

![](media/service-admin-auditing/search-audit-log-by-date.png)

## Search the audit logs by users

You can search for audit log entries for activities performed by specific users. To do this, enter one or more user names in the “Users” field.  This would be the username that they sign into Power BI with. It looks like an email address.
Leave this box blank to return entries for all users (and service accounts) in your organization.

![](media/service-admin-auditing/search-audit-log-by-user.png)

## Viewing search results

Once you hit the search button, the search results are loaded and after a few moments they are displayed under Results. When the search is finished, the number of results found is displayed. 

> [!NOTE]
> A maximum of 1000 events will be displayed; if more than 1000 events meet the search criteria, the newest 1000 events are displayed.

The results contain the following information about each event returned by the search.

| **Column** | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| Date |The date and time (in UTC format) when the event occurred. |
| IP address |The IP address of the device that was used when the activity was logged. The IP address is displayed in either an IPv4 or IPv6 address format. |
| User |The user (or service account) who performed the action that triggered the event. |
| Activity |The activity performed by the user. This value corresponds to the activities that you selected in the Activitiesdrop down list. For an event from the Exchange admin audit log, the value in this column is an Exchange cmdlet. |
| Item |The object that was created or modified as a result of the corresponding activity. For example, the file that was viewed or modified or the user account that was updated. Not all activities have a value in this column. |
| Detail |Additional detail about an activity. Again, not all activities will have a value. |

> [!NOTE]
> Select a column header under Results to sort the results. You can sort the results from A to Z or Z to A. Click the Date header to sort the results from oldest to newest or newest to oldest.

## View the details for an event

You can view more details about an event by selecting the event record in the list of search results. A details page is displayed that contains the detailed properties from the event record. The properties that are displayed depend on the Office 365 service in which the event occurs. To display additional details, select **More information**.

The following table provides details on that you may see displayed.

## Using PowerShell to search

You can use PowerShell to access the audit logs based on your login. This is done by accessing Exchange Online. Here is an example of a command to pull Power BI audit log entries.

> [!NOTE]
> In order to use the New-PSSession command, your account needs to have an Exchange Online license assigned to it and you need access to the audit log for your tenant.

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

$UserCredential = Get-Credential

$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $UserCredential -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection

Import-PSSession $Session
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate 9/11/2016 -EndDate 9/15/2016 -RecordType PowerBI -ResultSize 1000 | Format-Table | More
```

For more information on connecting to Exchange Online, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289\(v=exchg.160\).aspx).

For more information about parameters and usage of the Search-UnifiedAuditLog command, see [Search-UnifiedAuditLog](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt238501\(v=exchg.160\).aspx).
