# Create a copy of a Power BI dashboard
![](media/powerbi-service-create-a-dashboard-copy/power-bi-dashboard.png)

There are many different reasons to make a copy of a dashboard you own. The copy will be saved to the active (same) workspace. Maybe you want to make changes and test its performance against the original; or create slightly different versions to distribute by colleague, region, or team. Perhaps a colleague admires your dashboard design and wants to use it for reporting out to her managers. Another reason would be if you have a new database with the same data structure and data types and want to reuse the dashboard you've already created -- this too can be done but would require some work in Power BI Desktop. 

Dashboards that have been shared with you as an app cannot be duplicated.

1. Open the dashboard.
2. From the top-right corner, select the ellipses (...) and choose **Duplicate dashboard**.

3. Give the dashboard a name and select **Duplicate**.

4. The new dashboard is saved in the same workspace as the original.
