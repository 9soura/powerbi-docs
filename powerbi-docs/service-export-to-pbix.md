# Export a report from the Power BI service to Power BI Desktop
In Power BI Desktop, you can export (also referred to as *download*) a report to the Power BI service by saving the report and selecting **Publish**. You can also export in the other direction as well, and download a report from the Power BI service to Power BI Desktop. The extension for the exported files, in either case, is *.pbix*.

There are a few limitations and considerations to keep in mind, which are discussed later in this article.

## Download the report as a .pbix file

For you to be able to download the report, it must have been [created by using Power BI Desktop](guided-learning/publishingandsharing.yml?tutorial-step=2) after November 23, 2016, and updated since then. If it hasn't, the **Download report** menu option in the Power BI service is grayed out.

To download the .pbix file, follow these steps:

1. In the Power BI service, open the report you want to download in [Editing view](consumer/end-user-reading-view.md).

2. From the menubar, select **File > Download report**.
   
3. While the .pbix file is being created, a status banner displays the progress. When the file is ready, you'll be asked to open or save the .pbix file. The name of the file matches the title of the report.

    You now have the option of opening the .pbix file in either the Power BI service (app.powerbi.com) or Power BI Desktop.     
4. To immediately open the report in Desktop, select **Open**. To save the file to a specific location, select **Save > Save-As**. If you haven't already, [install Power BI Desktop](desktop-get-the-desktop.md).
   
    When you open the report in Power BI Desktop, you may see a warning message letting you know that some features available in the Power BI service report may not be available in Power BI Desktop.

5. The report editor in Power BI Desktop is similar to the report editor in the Power BI service.

## Considerations and troubleshooting
There are a few important considerations and limitations associated with downloading (exporting) a *.pbix* file from the Power BI service.

* To download the file, you must have edit access to the report
* The report must have been created by using **Power BI Desktop** and been *published* to the **Power BI service**, or the .pbix must have been *uploaded* to the Power BI service.
* Reports must be published or updated after November 23, 2016. Reports published earlier aren't downloadable.
* This feature won't work with reports and content packs originally created in the **Power BI service**.
* Always use the latest version of **Power BI Desktop** when you open downloaded files. Downloaded *.pbix* files might not open in non-current versions of **Power BI Desktop**.
* If your administrator has turned off the ability to export data, this feature won't be visible in the **Power BI service**.
* Datasets with incremental refresh can't be downloaded to a *.pbix* file.
