Dashboards are a portal to your company's life cycle and processes. A dashboard is an overview, a single place to monitor the current state of the business. Reports are an interactive view of your data, with visuals representing different findings and insights from that data. 

## Prerequisites

### Sign up for Power BI
If you're not signed up for Power BI, [sign up for a free trial](https://app.powerbi.com/signupredirect?pbi_source=web) before you begin.

### Install the Power BI for Android app
[Download the Power BI for Android app](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=544867) from Google Play.

Power BI works on a number of different Android devices, running the Android 5.0 operating system or later. To check your device, go to **Settings** > **About device** > **Android version**.

### Download the Retail Analysis sample
The first step in the quickstart is to download the Retail Analysis sample in the Power BI service.

1. Open the Power BI service in your browser (app.powerbi.com) and sign in.

1. Select the global navigation icon to open the left navigation.

OK, you're ready to view the sample on your Android device.

## View a dashboard on your Android device
1. On your Android device, open the Power BI app and sign in with your Power BI account credentials, the same ones you used in the Power BI service in the browser.

1.  Tap the global navigation button ![Global navigation button](media/mobile-ipad-app-get-started/power-bi-iphone-global-nav-button.png).

3. Tap the Retail Analysis Sample dashboard to open it.

    A notation below the dashboard name (in this case, the letter "C") shows how the data in each dashboard is classified. Read more about [data classification in Power BI](service-data-classification.md).

    Power BI dashboards look a little different on your Android phone. All the tiles appear the same width, and they're arranged one after another from top to bottom.

4. Tap the star icon ![Favorite star icon](media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-favorite-icon.png) in the title bar to make this a favorite dashboard.

4. Scroll down and tap the This Year's Sales, Last Year's Sales filled line chart.

    ![Tap a tile to go to focus mode](media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-tap-tile-fave.png)

    It opens in focus mode.

7. In focus mode, tap Apr in the chart. You see the values for April displayed at the top of the chart.
