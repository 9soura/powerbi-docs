# Set up dataset and dataflow certification (preview)

Your organization can certify datasets and dataflows that are the authoritative sources for critical information.

As a Power BI tenant admin, you are responsible for setting up the certification process for your organization. This means:
* Enabling certification on your tenant.
* Defining a list of groups and users who are authorized to certify datasets and dataflows.

See [Dataset and dataflow endorsement](../designer/service-dataset-dataflow-endorsement-overview.md) for more information about certification.


## Set up certification

1. In the Admin portal, go to Tenant settings.
1. Under the Export and sharing settings section, expand the Certification section.

These authorized certifiers will able to use the Certification button in the Endorsement section of the [dataset or dataflow](../designer/service-endorse-datasets-dataflows.md#request-dataset-or-dataflow-certification) settings page..
1. Click **Apply**.
