# Set up dataset and dataflow certification (preview)

Your organization can certify datasets and dataflows that are the authoritative sources for critical information.

As a Power BI tenant admin, you are responsible for setting up the certification process for your organization. This means:
* Enabling certification on your tenant.
* Defining a list of groups and users who are authorized to certify datasets and dataflows.

See [Dataset and dataflow endorsement](../connect-data/service-dataset-dataflow-endorsement-overview.md) for more information about certification.


## Set up certification

1. In the Admin portal, go to Tenant settings.
1. Under the Export and sharing settings section, expand the Certification section.

1. Set the toggle to **Enabled**.
1. For dataset certification, if your organization has a published certification policy, you can provide its URL here. This will become the Learn more link in the certification section of the [dataflow endorsement settings dialog].() 
1. Specify the users or groups who are authorized to certify datasets and dataflows. These authorized certifiers will able to use the Certification button in the Endorsement section of the [dataset](../service-datasets-certify.md) or [dataflow](../transform-model/service-dataflows-certify.md) settings page.
1. Click **Apply**.
