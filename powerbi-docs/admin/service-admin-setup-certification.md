# Enable certification datasets, dataflows, reports, and apps (preview)

Your organization can certify datasets, dataflows, reports, and apps to identify them as authoritative sources for critical information.

As a Power BI admin, you are responsible for enabling and setting up the certification process for your organization. This means:
* Enabling certification on your tenant.
* Defining a list of groups and users who are authorized to certify content.
* Providing a URL that points to the documentation for the organization's Power BI content certification process, if such documentation exists.

Certification is part of Power BI's *endorsement* feature. See [Endorsement: Promoting and certifying Power BI content](../colaborate-share/service-endorsement-overview.md) for more information.

## Set up certification

1. In the Admin portal, go to Tenant settings.
1. Under the Export and sharing settings section, expand the Certification section.

   ![Set up dataset and dataflow certification](media/service-admin-setup-certification/service-admin-certification-setup-dialog.png)

1. Set the toggle to **Enabled**.
1. If your organization has a published certification policy, provide its URL here. This will become the **Learn more** link in the certification section of the [endorsement settings dialog](../connect-data/service-datasets-promote.md#request-dataset-certification) 
1. Specify one or more security groups whose members will be authorized to certify content. These authorized certifiers will able to use the Certification button in the certification section of the [endorsement settings dialog](../connect-data/service-datasets-promote.md#request-dataset-certification).
    
    If a security group contains sub-security groups that you do not want to give certification rights to, you can check the **Except specific security groups** box and enter the name(s) of those group(s) in a text box that will appear.
1. Click **Apply**.
