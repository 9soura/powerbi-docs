# Migrate your subscription to the new "Go Local" German regions

Existing Microsoft Cloud Germany (Microsoft Cloud Deutschland) customers will be able to move their Power BI users to new “Go Local” German regions when migration becomes available this year. To initiate migration, the first step is to [opt-in to a Microsoft-assisted migration](https://aka.ms/office365germanymoveoptin) to our new German datacenter regions.

For organizations that opt in, migrations are expected to begin sometime in 2020. As a result of the migration, core customer data and subscriptions will be migrated to the new “Go Local” German regions.

After completion of the subscription migration, pricing will decrease to reflect the public cloud pricing. Direct customers will see a new subscription with a new annual renewal date. The following services will be migrated as part of this approach:

* Power BI

We'll continuously update this article in the coming months to add detailed information about prerequisites, step-by-step procedures, and any effect the migration will have on your organization.
