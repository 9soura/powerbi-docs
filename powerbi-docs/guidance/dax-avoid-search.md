# DAX: Avoid using SEARCH in measures

As a data modeler, sometimes you might need to write a DAX expression that tests whether specific characters exist within a text value. The [SEARCH](/dax/search-function-dax) DAX function let's you do this test. But, this function involves scanning, which is an expensive operationâ€”especially when Power BI must scan many text values (column values within filter context).

Consider a requirement to report on total sales results for products that are gloves. The model has a **Product** table that stores thousands of rows, and the text "gloves" is found in the product name for some rows.

![A Product table has three columns: ProductID, SKU, and ProductName. In the ProductName column, nine rows include the text "gloves".](media/dax-avoid-search/product-table-rows.png)

The following measure definition uses the SEARCH function to calculate the total sales result for gloves.

```dax
Glove Sales =
CALCULATE(
    [Sales],
    SEARCH("Gloves", 'Product'[ProductName], , -1) <> -1
)
```

While this calculation produces the required result, it forces an expensive scan of the **ProductName** column values _each time the measure is evaluated_.

Let's now consider a more efficient design. The search result is stored in a calculated column. This way, it's evaluated only when the **Product** table is refreshed.

```dax
IsGloveProduct = (SEARCH("Gloves", 'Product'[ProductName], , -1) <> -1)
```

![The Product table now has four columns. The IsGloveProduct is false, except for the nine glove product rows.](media/dax-avoid-search/product-table-rows-isgloveproduct.png)

The improved **Glove Sales** measure definition now filters by the **IsGloveProduct** column. It avoids the use of the SEARCH function.

```dax
Glove Sales =
CALCULATE(
    [Sales],
    'Product'[IsGloveProduct]
)
```

## Recommendation

For best performance, we recommend you avoid using the SEARCH function in measures. Instead, store the SEARCH function result in a calculated column, then use this column to filter measure expressions.
