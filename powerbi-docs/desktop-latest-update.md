# What's new in the latest Power BI Desktop update?

## September 2018 Update (2.62.5222.582)

Our September updates are like settling in to an exciting new classroom, more things to learn, building on previous experiences, and somehow more capable and mature than ever before. Hopefully you find these updates as useful as a handful of just-sharpened No. 2 pencils. 

You can now [download the latest version of Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop). If you're running Windows 10, you can also get **Power BI Desktop** from the Windows Store. The monthly versions are the same even though the version numbering may differ between the two, regardless of which way you install **Power BI Desktop**. See [this article](desktop-get-the-desktop.md) for more information. 

The links beside each update mean the following:

* **[video]** excerpts play in a new browser tab, when the feature is being discussed.
* Some features have an **[article]** that provides more detail.
* Most features are explained in the monthly update **[blog]** post.
* Lastly, some features are self-explanatory and don't need and article or video.

You can also watch the **Latest Updates** video from the beginning, right inside this article, by clicking on the **play** icon on the video image found below the list of updates.

The following updates are new to **Power BI Desktop** this month:
