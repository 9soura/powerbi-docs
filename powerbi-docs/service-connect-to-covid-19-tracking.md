# Connect to Covid-19  with Power BI
This article tells  you how to install the template app for the Covid-19 tracking report, and how to connect to the data sources.

For detailed information about the report itself, see the [COVID-19 tracking sample for US state and local governments](create-reports/sample-covid-19-us.md)

After you've installed the template app and connected to the data sources, you can customize the report as per your needs. You can then distribute it as an app to colleagues in your organization.
