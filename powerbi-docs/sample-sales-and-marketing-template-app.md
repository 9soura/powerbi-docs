# Explore a template app sample: Sales and Marketing - Power BI

The **Sales and Marketing** template app sample is similar to the original **Sales and Marketing** sample. Both contain a dashboard and report for a fictitious manufacturing company named VanArsdel Ltd. This version has an updated color palette and some newer Power BI features. For example, the report pages have buttons to take you to the previous page, and to open a Q&A window.
 However, because this version is a template app, you can modify it, and then distribute it as an app to others in your organization. 

This dashboard was created by the VanArsdel Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) to keep an eye on the industry and the company’s market share, product volume, sales, and sentiment. VanArsdel has many competitors but is the market leader in its industry. The CMO wants to increase market share and discover growth opportunities. But, for some reason, VanArsdel’s market share has started to decline, with significant dips in June. This sample is part of a series that illustrates how you can use Power BI with business-oriented data, reports and dashboards. This is real data from obviEnce (www.obvience.com) that has been anonymized. Read more about the the Sales and Marketing sample scenario.
