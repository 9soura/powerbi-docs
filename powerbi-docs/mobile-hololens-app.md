# Power BI app for HoloLens

## HoloLens Windows classic view basics

If you're new to the HoloLens experience, this section is for you. Interacting with a HoloLens app is different from interacting with a computer, or even with a tablet or phone. HoloLens apps respond to a set of gestures and voice commands that replace the traditional mouse and keyboard, or the phone tap. 

**Air taps**

The air tap is one of the most basic gestures that you need to know to interact with almost every HoloLens app. It's a tapping gesture with the hand held upright, similar to a mouse click or select.

In Power BI you use the air tap anywhere in the windows classic app you use the mouse click. Use can Air Tap to open a dashboard or report from your workspace, you can Air Tap a visual to cross highlight, etc.

**Pin icon** 

Tap the Pin icon ![Pin icon](media/mobile-hololens-app/power-bi-hololens-pin.png) to pin an item to holographic view. You can pin a number of items to holographic view, then pin them in a specific location in the physical space -- for example, next to a particular piece of equipment.


## HoloLens holographic view basics

When you're in the holographic view, you use voice commands complement the hand gestures. Here are some of them.

**"Follow me"** 

Pick up a Power BI artifact, so it will stay in your main field of vision, and will follow your gaze, until you place it elsewhere.

**"Dock"** 

Use the “dock” command to place an artifact in your Power BI docking belt, so it will follow you, outside of your main field of view, for easy access.

**"Place here"**

This command places a visual on a wall or object, or hovering in space.

**"Go home"**

Say “go home” to return to the Power BI classic windows app. 

**"Remove"**

Use this command to remove an artifact from view.

**"Remove all"** 

Use this command to remove all artifacts from view.
