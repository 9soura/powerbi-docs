Dashboards are a portal to your company's life cycle and processes. A dashboard is an overview, a single place to monitor the current state of the business.

## Create dashboards in the Power BI service (https://powerbi.com)
**You don't create dashboards in the mobile apps.** 

To see dashboards on your mobile device, you need to create or connect to them in a Web browser. 

1. Go to the Power BI service ([https://www.powerbi.com](https://www.powerbi.com)) and [sign up for an account](service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md).
2. [Create your own Power BI dashboards](service-dashboard-create.md), or connect to existing [content packs for a variety of services](service-connect-to-services.md).

Here's a Power BI dashboard in the Power BI service:

   * The yellow stars ![Favorite stars](media/powerbi-mobile-create-dashboard/power-bi-mobile-yes-favorite-icon.png) show which dashboards are favorites. 
   * The notation below each dashboard name (in this case, "MBI") ![Data classification](media/powerbi-mobile-create-dashboard/power-bi-dashboard-ios-medium-classification.png) shows how the data in each dashboard is classified. Read more about [data classification in Power BI](service-data-classification.md).
   
   By default, Power BI dashboards look a little different on your iPhone. All the tiles appear the same size, and they're arranged one after another from top to bottom.
