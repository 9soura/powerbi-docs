## Rename a page in a report
Don't like the name of a page in your Power BI report?  A new name is just a click away. Pages can be renamed in [report Editing view ](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md).

1. Open the report in [Editing View](powerbi-service-go-from-reading-view-to-editing-view.md).
2. Locate the report page tabs at the bottom of the Power BI window.

3. Open the report page that you'd like to rename by selecting the tab.
4. Double-click the name on the tab to highlight it.

5. Type a new report page name and select ENTER.

## Considerations and troubleshooting
* If the item to be renamed has been shared with you, or is part of a content pack, you won't see the gear icon and you won't have access to Settings.
* On the **Datasets** tab, if you don't see the ellipses (...), expand your browser window.
