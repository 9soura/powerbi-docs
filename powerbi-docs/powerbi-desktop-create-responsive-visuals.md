# Optimize a Power BI visual for any size
You can set the visuals in your dashboard or report to be *responsive*, to change dynamically to display the maximum amount of data and insight, no matter the screen size.

As a visual changes size, Power BI prioritizes the data view, for example removing padding and moving the legend to the top of the visual automatically, so the visual remains informative even as it gets smaller. Responsiveness is especially useful in visuals in the Power BI mobile app on phones.

You can turn on responsiveness for any visual with X and Y axes, and slicers.

## Turn on responsiveness in Power BI Desktop
1. In Power BI Desktop, on the **View** tab, make sure you're in **Desktop Layout**.
   
    ![Desktop Layout icon](media/powerbi-desktop-create-responsive-visuals/power-bi-desktop-layout.png)
2. Select a visual, and in the **Visualizations** pane select the **Format** section.
3. Expand **General** > slide **Responsive** to **On**.
   
    ![Responsive on](media/powerbi-desktop-create-responsive-visuals/power-bi-turn-responsive-on.png)
   
     Now when you [create a report optimized for the phone](desktop-create-phone-report.md) and add this visual, it will resize gracefully.

## Turn on responsiveness in the Power BI service
You turn on responsiveness for a visual in a report in the Power BI service. You need to be able to edit the report.

1. In a report in the Power BI service ([https://powerbi.com](https://powerbi.com)), select **Edit Report**.
2. Select a visual, and in the **Visualizations** pane select the **Format** section.
3. Expand **General** > slide **Responsive** to **On**.
   
    ![Responsive on](media/powerbi-desktop-create-responsive-visuals/power-bi-turn-responsive-on.png)
   
     Now when you [create a phone view of a dashboard](service-create-dashboard-mobile-phone-view.md) and add this visual, it will resize gracefully.
