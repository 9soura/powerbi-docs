# Power BI licensing in your organization

Power BI Pro is a paid licenses that enables more features. Power BI Pro licenses are for a team that wants to share and collaborate with others to make data-driven decisions.  Each team member creating or viewing shared Power BI content needs a Pro license unless the content is associated with a dedicated capacity using Power BI Premium.

These features require a Power BI Pro license:

* **Analyze data in Excel or Power BI Desktop** - Use Excel or Power BI Desktop to view and interact with a dataset published in Power BI. For more information, see [Analyze in Excel](service-analyze-in-excel.md).

* **Share dashboards and collaborate with workspaces** - Power BI workspaces facilitate collaboration with colleagues on dashboards, reports, and datasets. For more information, see [Collaborate in your Power BI app workspace](service-collaborate-power-bi-workspace.md).

* **View shared content** - Pro users can view dashboards and reports that are shared with them, interact with dashbaords and reports that are shareed with them, and re-share dashboards and reports that are shaed with them (if allowed). However, a Pro user cannot edit these dashboards or reports. For more information, see [Share your Power BI dashboards and reports with coworkers and others](service-share-dashboards.md).

* **Integrate content with Microsoft Teams** - You can add a Power BI tab in a Microsoft (MS) Teams channel. MS Teams automatically detects all the reports in the workspace. For more information, see [Power BI teams up with Microsoft Teams](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/power-bi-teams-up-with-microsoft-teams/).

## Purchasing Power BI Pro

# Power BI (free) in your organization
This will look at how the Power BI (free) offering can be used within your organization. An organization means that you have a tenant and can manage users and services within that tenant. As an administrator, you can control license assignment, or you can allow users to sign up as an individual. We will look at the Power BI (free) license and how you can control individual sign up.

## Individual sign up versus license assignment
Users within your organization can gain access to Power BI in two different ways. They can individually sign up for Power BI, or you can assign a Power BI license to them within the Office 365 admin portal.

Allowing individual sign up reduces the burden, from the organization administrators, by allowing the users that are interested in Power BI to sign up for free.

For more control, you can block individual sign up and assign Power BI licenses yourself within the Office 365 admin center. This allows you to be specific of who can access what services within your organization. This is also a great option if you have to deal with auditing and need to know exactly who can use what.

## How to get the unlimited license block
Within the Office 365 admin center, under **Billing** > **Licenses**, you may or may not see Power BI (free) with unlimited licenses.

![](media/service-admin-service-free-in-your-organization/unlimited-licenses.png)

This block of licenses will show up after the first time someone signs up for Power BI as an individual. During that process, this license block gets attached to your organization and a license is assigned to the user that is signing up.

If you are blocking individual user sign up, and no one has signed up, you will not see this license block. You can either allow individual user sign ups and have one user sign up, or you can get free licenses through the add subscription Office 365 flow which will be talked about next.

Once the Power BI (free) license block is available, you can assign those licenses to your users. For more information about how to assign licenses, see [Assign licenses to users in Office 365 ](https://support.office.com/article/Assign-or-unassign-licenses-for-Office-365-for-business-997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc).

## Getting free licenses via add subscription within Office 365
1. Navigate to the [Office 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/admin/default.aspx).
2. On the left navigation pane, select **Billing** > **Subscriptions**.
3. Select **Add subscriptions +** on the right side.
4. Under Other Plans, hover over the **ellipse (…)** for Power BI (free) and select **Buy now**.
   
    ![](media/service-admin-service-free-in-your-organization/buy-powerbi-free.png)
5. Enter the number of licenses you would like to add and select **Check out now** or **Add to cart**.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > You can add more at a later date if needed.
   > 
   > 
6. Enter the needed information in the check out flow.

There is no purchase when using this approach, although you will need to either enter your credit card information for billing, or choose to be invoiced.

If you decide later that you want to add more licenses, you can go back to **Add subscriptions**, and select **Change license quantity** for Power BI (free).

![](media/service-admin-service-free-in-your-organization/change-license-quantity.png)

You can now assign those licenses to your users. For more information about how to assign licenses, see [Assign licenses to users in Office 365 ](https://support.office.com/article/Assign-or-unassign-licenses-for-Office-365-for-business-997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc).

## Enable, or disable, individual user sign up in Azure Active Directory
As an administrator, you can choose to enable, or disable, individual user sign ups as part of Azure Active Directory (AAD). If you know how to leverage the AAD PowerShell commands, you can enable, or disable, ad-hoc subscriptions yourself. [Learn more](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj151815.aspx)

The AAD setting that controls this is **AllowAdHocSubscriptions**. Most tenants will have this setting set to true, which means it is enabled. If you acquired Power BI through a partner, this may be set to false by default, which means it is disabled.

1. You need to first sign into Azure Active Directory using your Office 365 credential. The first line will prompt you for your credentials. The second line connects to Azure Active Directory.
   
     $msolcred = get-credential
     connect-msolservice -credential $msolcred
   
   ![](media/service-admin-service-free-in-your-organization/aad-signin.png)
2. Once you are signed in, you can issue the following command to see what your tenant is currently configured for.
   
     Get-MsolCompanyInformation | fl AllowAdHocSubscriptions
3. You can this command to enable ($true) or disable ($false) AllowAdHocSubscriptions.
   
     Set-MsolCompanySettings -AllowAdHocSubscriptions $true

> [!NOTE]
> This blocking prevents new users in your organization from signing up for Power BI. Users that sign up for Power BI prior to disabling new signups for your organization will still retain their licenses.
