# Create a QR code for a report in Power BI to use in the mobile apps
QR codes in Power BI can connect anything in the real world directly to related BI information &#151; no navigation or search needed.

You can create a QR code in the Power BI service for any report, even for a report you can't edit. Then you place the QR code in a key location. For example, you could paste it in an email, or print it out and paste it in a specific location. 

Colleagues you've shared the report with can scan the QR code for access to the report, right from [their mobile device](mobile-apps-qr-code.md). They can use either the QR code scanner located in the Power BI app, or any other QR scanner installed on their device.

## Create a QR code for a report
1. Open a report in the Power BI service.
2. Select the ellipsis (...) in the top-right corner and select **Generate QR code**.

3. A dialog box with the QR code appears. 
   
    ![](media/service-create-qr-code-for-report/powerbi_report_qrcode.png)
4. From here you can scan the QR code or download and save it so you can: 
   
   * Add it to an email or other document, or 
   * Print it and place it in a specific location. 

## Print the QR code
Power BI generates the QR code as a JPG file, ready to print. 

1. Select **Download**, then open the JPG file on a computer connected to a printer.  
   
   > [!TIP]
   > The JPG file has the same name as the tile. For example, "Sales and Marketing Sample.jpg".
   > 
   > 
2. Print the file at 100% or “actual size”.  
3. Cut out the QR code along its edge and glue it to a place relevant to the report.
