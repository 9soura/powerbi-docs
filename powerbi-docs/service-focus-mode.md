# Display a dashboard tile or report visual in focus mode

## What is focus mode?
***Focus*** mode lets you expand (pop out) a dashboard tile or report visual to see more detail.  While in focus mode, you can view and modify filters that were applied when this visual was created.  

> [!NOTE]
> Focus is different from [full screen mode](service-tile-fullscreen-mode.md).
> 
## Focus mode for dashboard tiles
1. Hover over the tile visualization, select the ellipses (...) and choose **Open in focus mode** ![](media/service-focus-mode/power-bi-dashboard-focus-mode.png).  
   
2. The tile opens and fills the entire report canvas.

3. Expand the Filters pane to see all filters applied to this visual.

4. Explore further by modifying the filters and, if you discover something interesting, pin the visual to a dashboard.

5. Leave focus mode and return to the dashboard by selecting **< Exit focus mode** (in the top left corner of the visual).

4. Explore further by modifying the filters and, if you discover something interesting, pin the visual to a dashboard.   
5. Leave focus mode and return to the report by selecting **Back to report** (in the top left corner of the visual).

## Go from focus mode to full screen mode
Once in focus mode, the tile or visual can then be [viewed in full screen (TV mode.)](service-fullscreen-mode.md) Full screen mode displays without the distraction of menus and navigation buttons.

## Considerations and troubleshooting
* When using focus mode with a visualization in a report, you'll be able to view and modify all filters: Visual level, Page level and Report level.    
* When using focus mode with a visualization on a dashboard, you'll be able to view and modify only the Visual level filter.
