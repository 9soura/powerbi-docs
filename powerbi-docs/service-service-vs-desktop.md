# Comparing Power BI Desktop and the service

In the Venn diagram comparing Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service, a large area in the middle shows where the two overlap. Some tasks you can carry out either in Power BI Desktop or the service. But on both sides of the diagram, each offers a number of unique features. The application and the service share a core set of features, but each also has features the other doesn't.  

![Editing a report in Power BI Desktop or in the service](media/service-service-vs-desktop/power-bi-editing-desktop-service.png)

**Power BI Desktop** is a free application you can install on your local computer that lets you connect to, transform, and visualize your data. With Power BI Desktop, you can connect to multiple different sources of data, and combine them (often called modeling) into a data model. 

On the other hand, the **Power BI service** is a cloud-based, online service. You can connect to data sources in the Power BI service, too, but modeling is limited. 

In both, you can build *reports*, with visuals and collections of visuals. You can add bookmarks, buttons, and drillthrough, to enhance navigation in your reports.

Then in the **Power BI service**, you can save those reports and datasets to a *workspace* where you can collaborate with your colleagues. You can build *dashboards* on top of those reports. Then you can share those reports with report consumers inside and outside your organization. Most people who work on business intelligence projects use **Power BI Desktop** to create reports, and then use the **Power BI service** to share their reports with others.
_________________________

The report editor in Power BI service and the report editor in Power BI Desktop are similar. The video shows the report editor in Power BI Desktop and this article shows the report editor in Power BI service. 

If you're a report owner or contributor to a workspace (a *creator*), you can create and edit reports and dashboards in Editing view. If you're a report *consumer*, you can open and interact with the report in the Power BI service in [Reading view](consumer/end-user-reading-view.md). You don't have access all the features available to report creators.

The Power BI report editor is made up of 3 sections:  

1. **Fields**, **Visualizations**, and **Filters** panes
2. top navigation bars    
3. report canvas     

![](media/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour/power-bi-report-canvas.png)

## 1. The report editor panes
![Power BI report editor](media/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour/power-bi-report-panes.png)

There are 3 panes visible when you first open a report: Visualizations, Filters, and Fields. The panes on the left side, Visualizations and Filters, control what your visualizations look like -- type, colors, filtering, formatting.  And the pane on the right side, Fields, manages the underlying data being used in the visualizations. 

The content displayed in the report editor varies by selections you make in the report canvas.  For example, when you select an individual visual, 

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ![](media/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour/power-bi-panes.png) |<ul><li>The top of the Visualization pane identifies the type of visual in use; in this example, a Clustered column chart.<br><br></li> <li>The bottom of the Visualization pane (you may have to scroll down) displays the fields being used in the visual. This chart is using FiscalMonth, DistrictManager, and Total Sales Variance. <br><br></li><li>The Filters pane (you may have to scroll down) displays any filters that have been applied. <br><br></li><li>The Fields pane lists the tables available and, if you expand a table's name, the fields that make up that table. Yellow font lets you know  that at least one field from that table is being used in the visualization.<br><br></li><li>![paint roller icon](media/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour/power-bi-paint-roller-icon.png) To display the formatting pane, for the selected visualization, select the paint roller icon.<br><br></li><li>![magnifying glass icon](media/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour/power-bi-magnifying-icon.png) To display the Analystics pane, select the magnifying glass icon.</ul> |

## The Visualizations pane (from top to bottom)
![top of Visualization pane](media/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour/selectviz.png)

Here is where you select a visualization type. The small pictures are called *templates*. In the image above, the Clustered bar chart is selected. If you don't select a visualization type first, but instead start building a visualization by selecting fields, Power BI will pick the visualization type for you. You can keep Power BI's selection, or change the type by selecting a different template. Switch as many times as you need to find the visualization type that best represents your data.

### Manage the fields used in your visual.
![middle of Visualization pane](media/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour/power-bi-field-list.png)

The buckets (sometimes called *wells*) shown in this pane vary depending on what type of visualization you have selected.  For example, if you've selected a bar chart, you'll see buckets for: Values, Axis, and Legend. When you select a field, or drag it onto the canvas, Power BI adds that field to one of the buckets.  You can also drag fields from the Fields list directly into the buckets.  Some buckets are limited to certain types of data.  For example, **Values** won't accept non-numeric fields. So if you drag an **employeename** field into the **Values** bucket, Power BI changes it to **count of employeename**.

### Remove a field
To remove a field from the visualization, select the **X** to the right of the field name.

![Remove StoreType from Legend](media/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour/deletefield.png)

For more information, see [Add visualizations to a Power BI report](visuals/power-bi-report-add-visualizations-i.md)

### Format your visuals
Select the paint roller icon to display the Format pane. The option available depend on the type of visualization selected.

![Formatting pane](media/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour/power-bi-formatting.png)

The formatting possibilities are almost endless.  To learn more, explore on your own, or visit these articles:

* [Color formatting](visuals/service-getting-started-with-color-formatting-and-axis-properties.md)
* [Customizing X-axis and Y-axis properties](visuals/power-bi-visualization-customize-x-axis-and-y-axis.md)

### Add analytics to your visualizations
Select the magnifying glass icon to display the Analytics pane. The option available depend on the type of visualization selected.

![](media/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour/power-bi-analytics.png)    
With the Analytics pane in Power BI service, you can add dynamic reference lines to visualizations, and provide focus for important trends or insights. To learn more, see [Analytics pane in Power BI service](service-analytics-pane.md) or [Analytics pane in Power BI Desktop](desktop-analytics-pane.md).

## The Filters pane
Use the Filters pane to view, set, and modify persistent filters to your reports at the page, report, drillthrough, and visual-level. Yes, you can do ad-hoc filtering on report pages and visuals by selecting elements of the visuals or by using tools like slicers, but by using the Filters pane the state of the filters is saved with the report. 

The Filters pane has one other powerful feature - the ability to filter using a field ***that is not alrealdy being used in one of the visuals in your report***. Let me explain. When you create a report page, Power BI automatically adds all the fields you use in your visualizations to the Visual level filters area of the Filters pane.  But, if you want to set a visual, page, drillthrough, or report filter using a field that is not currently used in a visualization, just drag it to one of the Filters buckets.   

![Filters pane](media/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour/power-bi-formatting-pane.png)

For more information, see [Add a filter to a report](power-bi-report-add-filter.md).

## The Fields pane
The Fields pane displays the tables and fields that exist in your data and are available for you to use to create visualizations.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ![the Fields pane](media/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour/reportfields.png) |<ul><li>Drag a field onto the page to start a new visualization.  You can also drag a field onto an existing visualization to add the field to that visualization.<br><br></li> <li>When you add a checkmark next to a field, Power BI adds that field to the active (or new) visualization. And it also decides which bucket to place that field into.  For example, should the field be used a legend, axis,or value? Power BI makes a best-guess and you can move it from that bucket to another if necessary. <br><br></li><li>Either way, each selected field is added to the Visualizations pane in the report editor.</li></ul> |

**NOTE**: If you're using Power BI Desktop, you'll also have options to show/hide fields, add calculations etc.

### What do the field icons mean?
* **âˆ‘ Aggregates**
  An aggregate is a numeric value that will be summed or averaged, for example. Aggregates are imported with the data (defined in the data model your report is based on).
  For more information, see [Aggregates in Power BI reports](service-aggregates.md).
* ![calculator icon](media/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour/pbi_calculated_icon.png) **Calculated measures (also called calculated fields)**  
   Each calculated field has its own hard-coded formula. You canâ€™t change the calculation, for example, if itâ€™s a sum, it can only be a sum. For more information, [read Understanding measures](desktop-measures.md)
* ![Unique field icon](media/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour/icon.png) **Unique fields**  
   Fields with this icon were imported from Excel and are set to show all values, even if they have duplicates. For example your data might have two records for people named 'John Smith', and each will be treated as unique -- they won't be summed.  
* **![Geography icon](media/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour/pbi_geo_icon.png) Geography fields**  
   Location fields can be used to create map visualizations. 
* **![Hierarchy icon](media/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour/power-bi-hierarchy-icon.png) Hierarchy**  
   Select the arrow to reveal the fields that make up the hierarchy.

## 2. The top navigation bar
The actions available from the top navigation bar are numerous; with new actions being added all the time. For information about a particular action, use the Power BI Documentation Table of Contents or Search box.

## 3. The report canvas
The report canvas is where your work displays. When you use the Fields, Filters, and Visualizations panes to create visuals, they are built and displayed on your report canvas. Each tab at the bottom of the canva represents a page in the report. Select a tab to open that page.
