# Track Power BI service health in Office 365

The Office 365 admin center provides important tools for Power BI administrators, including current and historical information about service health. To access this information, you must be in one of the following roles: Power BI Service Administrator, or Office 365 Global Administrator. For more information about roles, see [What is Power BI administration?](service-admin-administering-power-bi-in-your-organization.md).


1. Sign in to the [Office 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/adminportal).

2. Select the **Service health** tile.
