# Featured dashboards in Power BI service
## Create a Featured dashboard
Many of us have one dashboard that we visit more than any others.  It might be the dashboard we use to run our business, or it might be a dashboard that contains an aggregation of tiles from many different dashboards and reports.

When you select a dashboard as *featured*, each time you open Power BI service, it will open with that dashboard displayed.  

You can also select a few dashboards and set them as *favorites*. See [Dashboard favorites](service-dashboard-favorite.md).

> [!NOTE] 
>This topic applies to Power BI service, and not to Power BI Desktop.

If you haven't yet set a featured dashboard, Power BI will open to the last dashboard you used.  

### To set a dashboard as **featured**
Watch Amanda create a featured dashboard and then follow the instructions below the video to try it out yourself.

1. Open the dashboard that you'd like to set as *Featured*. 
2. In the top navbar, you'll either see **Set as featured** or just the featured  ![](media/service-dashboard-featured/power-bi-featured-icon.png)  icon. Select either one.

## Change the featured dashboard
Of course, if you change your mind later you can set a new dashboard as the featured dashboard.

1. Follow steps 1 and 2 from above.

2. Select **Set as featured**. Un-featuring a dashboard does not remove it from your workspace.

## Remove the featured dashboard
If you decide that you don't want any dashboard to be designated as featured, here's how to un-feature a dashboard.

1. Open the currently-featured dashboard.
2. In the top menubar, select **Disable featured**.

Now Power BI will open to the last dashboard you used.
