# Display the dashboards and reports that have been shared with me
## Shared with me

When a colleague shares content with you, using the **Share** button, it appears in your **Shared with me** container. The dashboard or report is only available from **Shared with me** and not available from **Apps**.

Watch Amanda explain the **Shared with me** content list and demonstrate how to navigate and filter the list. Then follow the step-by-step instructions below the video to try it out yourself. For you to view dashboards shared with you, you need to have a Power BI Pro license. Read [What is Power BI Premium?](../service-premium.md) for details.

You'll have options for interacting with the dashboards and  reports, depending on the permissions the designer gives you. These include being able to make copies of the dashboard, open the report [in Reading view](end-user-reading-view.md), and re-share with other colleagues.

* Select the name of a dashboard to open it and explore. Once you've opened the shared dashboard you can use Q&A to ask questions about the underlying data or select a tile to open and interact with the report in Reading view.

## Filter shared dashboards by owner
The content in the **Shared with me** screen can be further filtered by content owner. For example, if I select **Amanda**, I see only the dashboard that Amanda has shared with me.
