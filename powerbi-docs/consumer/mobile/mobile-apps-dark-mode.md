# Dark mode

To accommodate your individual viewing preferences, the Power BI mobile app for iOS offers dark and light screen modes. Light mode features dark text against light backgrounds, while dark mode has light text against dark backgrounds. Dark mode reduces the brightness of the screen, making it easier to see your content. In the apps appearance settings, you can choose which mode you’d like to use, or you can let the app use your device’s system settings to determine which mode to display.

In dark mode, all app experiences appear with a dark background. Changing to dark mode does not affect the appearance of Power BI content, however. Your reports, dashboards, and apps, will continue to be displayed as the designers intended. 

To change between light and dark mode, or to let device settings determine the mode, go to **Settings > Appearance** and choose your desired mode.
