# Using Siri shortcuts in Power BI Mobile iOS App (preview)

### Use Siri shortcuts to directly access the Power BI content you need.

To get easy and quick access to your frequently used reports or dashboards, use the Siri shortcut integration. Create a shortcut to your item. Anf then you can ask Siri to launch it when even you need to have a look on the data.

## Create Siri shortcut for a report or dashboard

There are three ways to create Siri shortcut to your reports and dashboards.

    1. A banner with a ***'Add to Siri’*** option will be added to your frequently used reports and dashboards. Tapp the action to open the 'Add to Siri' page.
    
    2. Use the 'Siri shortcut' action from the {...} Report/Dashboard menu.
    
    3. Use the 'Suggested shortcuts' in the device settings (Device Setting -> Siri & Search), you can add a shortcut to the item in the suggestion list bu pressing th '+' button

All the options above will open the 'Add to Siri' page. In this page you will need to record a phrase, that you will be used later with Siri in order to open the report or dashboard.

## Use Siri shortcut 

Once you created a shortcut, every time you’d like to access the dashboard or the report you created a shortcut for, just ask Siri by using the phrase recorded in the shortcut. Siri will launch Power BI and land on the report or dashboard in the shortcut.
