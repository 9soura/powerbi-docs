# Power BI for Windows 10 Mobile: End of Support for Windows Phones 

**Applies to: Windows phone**

[Back to the Microsoft Lifecycle Policy home page](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle)

Published: March 16, 2020 

The Power BI mobile app for **phones using Windows 10 Mobile** will reach end of support on March 16, 2021*. On that date, app users will no longer receive security updates, non-security hotfixes, free assisted support options or online technical content updates from Microsoft. This decision follows the earlier [announcement](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4484693) that support for Windows 10 Mobile ends December 10, 2019.  

It is recommended that users transition to the latest Power BI mobile apps for iOS or Android phones, prior to the end of support.

*Power BI mobile phone apps for Windows 10 Mobile will no longer be available to install after March 16, 2021. For users who already have the apps installed on that date, the apps will continue to work with the limitations above. Power BI will continue to support apps for other devices running Windows 10.
