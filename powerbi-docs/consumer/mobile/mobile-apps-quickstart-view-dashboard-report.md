Dashboards are a portal to your company's life cycle and processes. A dashboard is an overview, a single place to monitor the current state of the business. Reports are an interactive view of your data, with visuals representing different findings and insights from that data.

## Prerequisites

### Sign up for Power BI

2. Select **Get data** in the lower-left corner of the navigation pane. If the navigation pane is hidden and you can't see the Get data link, display the pane by clicking the show/hide navigation pane icon.

    When you make a favorite in the mobile app, it's a favorite in the Power BI service, and vice versa.

4. Scroll down and tap the "This Year's Sales, Last Year's Sales" filled line chart.

    ![Tap a tile to go to focus mode](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-tap-tile-fave.png)
