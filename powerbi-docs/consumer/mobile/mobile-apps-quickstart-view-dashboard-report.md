A dashboard is a portal to your company's life cycle and processes. It is an overview, a single place to monitor the current state of the business. Reports are interactive views of your data, with visuals representing different findings and insights from that data.

## Prerequisites

* **Sign up for Power BI**: If you're not signed up for Power BI, [sign up for a free trial](https://app.powerbi.com/signupredirect?pbi_source=web) before you begin.
* **Install the Power BI app for your device**: Download the Power BI mobile app** from the [App store](https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-power-bi/id929738808) (iOS) or [Google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.powerbim&amp;amp;clcid=0x409) (Android).
* **Download the Retail Analysis sample**: The first step in this quickstart is to download the Retail Analysis sample in the Power BI service. [Learn how to download a sample](./mobile-apps-download-samples.md) into your Power BI account to get started. Be sure to choose the Retail Analysis sample.

Once you've completed the prerequisites and downloaded the Retail Analysis sample to your Power BI account, you are ready to begin this quick tour.

## View a dashboard on your mobile device
1. On your device, open the Power BI app and sign in with your Power BI account credentials, the same ones you used in the Power BI service in the browser.

    The app opens to the home page.

   ![My Workspace](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-quickstart-home.png)

    The home page has two tabs: 
    * **Quick access** provides quick access your frequently or recently viewed content. 
    * **Activity** shows what's happening in your dashboards and reports, as well as latest comments and activities. 

    The home page also has a navigation bar across the bottom of the screen to help you get to your content quickly. 
    * **Home**: displays the home page
    * **Favorites**: displays the Favorites page, which lists contents you have marked as favorites.
    * **Apps**: displays the Apps page, which lists the apps installed in your Power BI account.
    * **Workspaces**: displays the Workspaces page, where your workspaces are listed.
    * **More options (â€¦)**: displays three other options: 
      * **Recents**: displays the Recents page that lists recently viewed content, categorized by *Visited today*, *Visited this week*.
      * **Shared with me**: lists content that is shared with you.
      * **Scanner**: Report creators can create QR codes for their reports. Then, when you scan the QR code with this option, you see the tile that the report creator has associated with that code. [Learn more](mobile-apps-scan-barcode-iphone.md).

    At the top of the home page, a **Notifications** button indicates when there is a notification or data alert. Tap the button to see any notifications. Learn more about [Learn more about notifications and alerts](mobile-set-data-alerts-in-the-mobile-apps.md).
  
    Finally, a **Search** button enables you to look for your dashboards, reports and apps.
 
1. Now, tap **Workspaces** on the navigation bar.
    The Workspaces page lists your workspaces. If My Workspace is your only workspace, the Workspaces navigation bar button will display the contents of My Workspace directly.

1. Tap **My Workspaces**

    ![Home](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-myworkspaces.png)
    
    In My Workspace, you see lists of your dashboards and reports.
    
    ![Dashboards in My Workspace](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-open-retail.png)
    
    A notation below the dashboard names shows how the data in each dashboard is classified. Read more about [data classification in Power BI](../../service-data-classification.md).

4. Tap the Retail Analysis Sample dashboard to open it.

    ![Dashboards in My Workspace](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-dashboard.png)
   
    Power BI dashboards look a little different on your mobile device than they do on the Power BI service. All the tiles appear the same width, and they're arranged one after another from top to bottom.

5. Tap the star icon ![Favorite star icon](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-favorite-icon.png) in the title bar to make this a favorite dashboard. When you make a favorite in the mobile app, it becomes a favorite in the Power BI service, and vice versa.

6. Scroll down and tap the "This Year's Sales, Last Year's Sales" filled line chart.

    ![Tap a tile to go to focus mode](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-tap-tile-fave.png)

    It opens in focus mode.

7. In focus mode, tap **Apr** in the chart. The values for April appear at the top of the chart.

    ![Tile in focus mode](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-tile-focus.png)

8. Tap the Report icon ![Report icon](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-report-icon.png) at the bottom of the screen (on Android devices this may be at the top of the screen). The report related to this tile opens in landscape mode.

    ![Report in landscape mode](././media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-report.png)

9. Tap the yellow "040 - Juniors" bubble in the bubble chart. Note how it highlights related values in the other charts. 

    ![Highlight values in a report](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-cross-highlight.png)

10. Swipe up to see a toolbar across the bottom, and tap **More options (...)**.

    ![Tap the pencil](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-tap-pencil.png)


11. Scroll down the list and select **Annotate**.

    ![Tap the pencil](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-tap-pencil2.png)

12. On the annotate toolbar, tap the smiley-face icon and then tap the report page where you'd like to add some smiley faces.
 
    ![Annotate the page](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-annotate.png)

13. Now tap **Share** in the upper-right corner.

    ![New email message with snapshot and link](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-send-snapshot.png)

    You can share this snapshot with anyone, in or out of your organization. If they're in your organization and have their own Power BI account, they'll be able to open the Retail Analysis sample report, too.
