# iOS Device Search (Spotlight) integration with Power BI Mobile iOS App (preview)
Use iOS device search to find and access the content you need

When you use iOS device search (spotlight) to look for specific content, Power BI items are included in the result list. Tapping on Power BI item from the result list will take you directly to that item inside Power BI app.

To find items using device search:

1. Swipe down from the middle of the **Home** screen to get into the device search.

2. Tap the **Search** field and type the text you are looking for.
 
   The search results will include Power BI items of the following types 

    * Dashboards
    * Reports
    * Apps
    * Workspaces
    * Items shared by the contact you search for
