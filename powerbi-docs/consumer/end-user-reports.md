# Reports in Power BI
## What is a Power BI report?
A Power BI ***report*** is a multi-perspective view into a dataset, with visuals that represent different findings and insights from that dataset.  A report can have a single visual or pages full of visuals. Depending on your job role, you may be someone who *designs* reports and/or you may be someone who *consumes* or uses reports.

This report has six pages (or tabs) and we're currently viewing the Sentiment page. On this page are 6 different visuals and a page title.  

If you're new to Power BI, you can get a good foundation by reading [Power BI basic concepts](end-user-basic-concepts.md)

Reports are available for viewing, sharing, and annotating on mobile devices. For more information, see [Power BI mobile reports](mobile/mobile-reports-in-the-mobile-apps.md).

## Advantages of reports
A report is based on a single dataset. The visuals in a report are created by report *designers* and represent a nugget of information. And the visuals aren't static; you can interact with the visuals and filters as you dig into the data to discover insights and look for answers. Like a dashboard, but more-so, a report is highly interactive and highly customizable and the visuals update as the underlying data changes.

### Safely interact with content
As you explore and interact with your content, filtering, slicing, subscribing, and exporting, rest assured; your work does not affect the underlying dataset or the original shared content (dashboards, reports, and apps).
 
> [!NOTE]
> Remember, you cannot hurt your data. Power BI is a great place for you to explore and experiment without worrying that you’ll “break” anything.

### Save your changes or revert to the default settings
That doesn't mean you can't save your changes; you can, but those changes only affect your view of the content. Reverting to the original default view is as simple as selecting the Reset to default button.

## Dashboards versus reports
[Dashboards](end-user-dashboards.md) are often confused with reports since they too are canvases filled with visuals. But there are some major differences.  

| **Capability** | **Dashboards** | **Reports** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pages |One page |One or more pages |
| Data sources |One or more reports and one or more datasets per dashboard |A single dataset per report |
<!--| Available in Power BI Desktop |No |Yes, can create and view reports in Desktop |
| Pinning |Can pin existing visuals (tiles) only from current dashboard to your other dashboards |Can pin visuals (as tiles) to any of your dashboards. Can pin entire report pages to any of your dashboards. | -->
| Filtering |Can't filter or slice |Many different ways to filter, highlight, and slice |
| Set alerts |Can create alerts to email you when certain conditions are met |No |
| Feature |Can set one dashboard as your "featured" dashboard |Cannot create a featured report |
| Can see underlying dataset tables and fields |No. Can export data but can't see the dataset tables and fields in the dashboard itself. |Yes. Can see dataset tables and fields and values that you have permissions to see. |
| Customization |No  |Can filter, export, view related content, add bookmarks, generate QR codes, analyze in Excel, and more.   |

## Report ***creators*** and report ***consumers***
Depending on your role, you may be a *designer*, someone who creates reports for your own use or to share with colleagues. You want to learn how to create and share reports. Or, you may be someone who receives reports from others. You want to learn how to understand and interact with the reports. If you are a report **consumer**, these links are for you. 

* Start with a [tour of Power BI service](end-user-basic-concepts.md) so you know where to find reports and report tools.
* Learn how to [open a report](end-user-report-open.md) and all the interaction available in [Reading view](end-user-reading-view.md).
* Get comfortable with reports by taking a tour of one of our [samples](../sample-tutorial-connect-to-the-samples.md).  
<!--* Don't need the report any more? You can [remove it](../service-delete.md).-->
* To see which dataset the report is using and which dashboards have tiles pinned from the report, [view related content](end-user-related.md).
