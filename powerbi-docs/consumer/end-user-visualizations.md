# Visualizations for Power BI **consumers**

At its most basic, a ***visualization*** (or *visual*), is a type of chart built by Power BI *designers* using the data in *reports* and *datasets*. 

> [!TIP]
> We recommend first reading the overview topic [Power BI basic concepts for *consumers*](end-user-basic-concepts.md) before reading this more-detailed content.

## What can I do with visualizations?

Visualizations are created by report and dashboard *designers* and shared with *consumers*. As a consumer, you have many options for interacting with visualizations to uncover insights and make data-driven business decisions. All of these options are listed below with links to step-by-step instructions.

But first, a word about Q&A. Q&A is Power BI's natural language search tool. You type a question using natural language and Q&A answers the question in the form of a visualization. Q&A is a way consumers can create their own visualizations. However, the visualizations you create with Q&A cannot be saved. But, if there's something specific you want to learn from the data, and the designer didn't include it in a report or on a dashboard, Q&A is a great option. To learn more about Q&A, see [Q&A for consumers](end-user-q-and-a.md).

|[Ask Power BI to look for interesting facts or trends](end-user-insights.md) in the visualization's data for you.  These are called *auto insights*.     |    yes     |   yes      | no   |
|[View just one visualization at a time using *focus* mode](end-user-focus.md).     | yes        |   yes      | no  |
