# Interact with Visuals in reports, dashboards, and apps

At its most basic, a ***visualization*** (or *visual*), is a type of chart built by Power BI *designers* using the data in reports and datasets. 

> [!TIP]
> We recommend first reading the overview topic [Power BI basic concepts for *consumers*](end-user-basic-concepts.md) before reading this more-detailed content.

## What can I do with visuals?

Visuals are created by report and dashboard *designers* and shared with *consumers*. As a consumer, you have many options for interacting with visuals to uncover insights and make data-driven business decisions. All of these options are listed in the table below, with links to step-by-step instructions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> But first, a word about Q&A. Q&A is Power BI's natural language search tool. You type a question using natural language and Q&A answers the question in the form of a visual. Q&A is a way consumers can create their own visuals. However, the visuals you create with Q&A cannot be saved. But, if there's something specific you want to learn from the data, and the designer didn't include it in a report or on a dashboard, Q&A is a great option. To learn more about Q&A, see [Q&A for consumers](end-user-q-and-a.md).
