# View a dashboard
Power BI consumers spend a lot of time viewing dashboards. Dashboards are designed to highlight specific information from the underlying reports and datasets. And Power BI consumers use that information for tracking, monitoring, answering questions, testing, and more -- in order to make data-driven business decisions.

Power BI Pro is required for both sharing a dashboard and viewing a shared dashboard.

## Open a dashboard
Dashboards can be opened from many locations in Power BI service.  The key is figuring out which content is a dashboard (versus a report, for example). Once you've identified a dashboard, opening it is simple - just click and the dashboard fills your Power BI canvas.

You may find dashboards in all of the containers in the left navigation bar.

- **Favorites** - if you've [set a dashboard as a favorite](end-user-favorite.md)
- **Recent** - if you've recently visited a dashboard
- **Apps** - most apps contain both dashboards and reports
- **Shared with me** - if a colleague has [shared a dashboard with you](end-user-shared-with-me.md)
- **My workspace** - if you've downloaded any of the [Power BI samples](../sample-datasets.md)
