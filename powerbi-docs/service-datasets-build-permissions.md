# Build permissions for shared datasets (Preview)

As a dataset owner, you can promote your datasets so others can discover them easily. Learn how you can  keep control of who has access to the data by using the Build permission. 

The Build permission type is only relevant for datasets. With it, users can build new content on a dataset, such as reports, dashboards, pinned tiles from Q&A, and Insights Discovery. They can also build new content on the dataset outside Power BI, such as Excel sheets via Analyze in Excel, XMLA, and export.

Users can get the permission in different ways:

- A member of the workspace where the dataset resides can assign the permission to specific users or security groups in the Permission Center. Click the ellipsis (â€¦) next to a dataset > **Manage Permissions**.
- An admin or member of the workspace where the dataset resides can decide during app publishing that users with permission for the app also get Build permission for the underlying datasets.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you assign Build permissions to **Entire organization**, then no one in the organization will have Build permissions. You need to specify email addresses in **Specific individuals or groups**, even if you specify an email alias for the entire organization. 
- Say you have Reshare and Build permissions on a dataset. When you share a report or dashboard built on top of that dataset you can specify that the recipients also get Build permission for the underlying dataset.

## Expanding the kinds of permissions

Power BI introduced the Build permission in April 2019 as a complement to the existing permissions, Read and Reshare. All users who already had Read permission for datasets via app permissions, sharing, or workspace access at that time also got Build permissions for those same datasets. They got Build permission automatically because Read permission already granted them the right to build new content on top of the dataset, by using Analyze in Excel or Export.

With this more granular Build permission, you can choose who can only view the content in the existing report or dashboard and who can create content connected to the underlying datasets.
