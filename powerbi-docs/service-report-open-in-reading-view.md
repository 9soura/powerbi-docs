# Open a Power BI report in Reading View
## Reading View
Reading View is a great way to explore the data in a Power BI report, without worrying that you'll break something.  You can browse the report, interact with the visualizations, and pin any of the visualizations to your dashboard. 

> [!NOTE]
> To edit the report and save your changes, [open it in Editing View](service-reading-view-and-editing-view.md).
> 
> 

1. Start in a workspace and select the **Reports** tab to display all reports in that workspace.

2. Select the report name to open it in Reading View.  There are plenty of other ways to open a report; for example, you could start on a dashboard and select a tile that was created from a report.  Selecting the tile opens the report in Reading view.
