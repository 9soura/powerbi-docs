# Create a responsive slicer you can resize in Power BI
With responsive slicers, you can resize them to a variety of different sizes and shapes, from horizontal to square to vertical, and the values in the slicer rearrange themselves as you do. You make them as small or as large as you want, so they fit well on your reports in the Power BI service and also in the Power BI mobile apps. You can create them in Power BI Desktop and in the Power BI service.

## Create a slicer

The first step to creating a dynamic slicer is to create a basic slicer. 

1. Select the **Slicer** icon ![Slicer icon](media/power-bi-slicer-filter-responsive/power-bi-slicer-icon.png) in the **Visualizations** pane.
2. Drag the field you want to filter on to **Field**.

## Convert it to a horizontal slicer

This step is easy.

1. With the slicer selected, in the Visualizations pane select the Format tab.
2. Expand the General section, then for Orientation, select Horizontal.

1.  You'll probably want to make it wider, to show more values.

## Make it a responsive slicer

## Add it to a phone report layout

You can make a responsive slicer so small, it becomes just a filter icon. When your report readers select it, it expands to show the values to choose from.
