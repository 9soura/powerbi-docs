# Create a responsive slicer you can resize in Power BI
With the **responsive slicer**, you can resize it to a variety of different sizes and shapes, from horizontal to square to vertical, and the selections in the slicer rearrange themselves as you do. You can create them in Power BI Desktop and in the Power BI service.

1. Select the **Slicer** icon ![Slicer icon](media/power-bi-slicer-filter-responsive/power-bi-slicer-icon.png) in the **Visualizations** pane.
2. Drag the field you want to filter on to **Field**.
