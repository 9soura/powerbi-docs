# Quickstart: Explore the Power BI Report Server web portal in a VM
In this quickstart, you create a virtual machine with Power BI Report Server already installed, so you can experience viewing, editing, and managing sample Power BI and paginated reports, and KPIs.

You can view the web portal in any modern browser. In the web portal, reports and KPIs are organized in folders, and you can mark them as favorites. You can also store Excel workbooks there. From the web portal, you can launch the tools you need to create reports:

* **Power BI reports** created with Power BI Desktop: View them in the web portal and the Power BI mobile apps.
* **Paginated reports** created in Report Builder: Modern-looking, fixed-layout documents optimized for printing.
* **KPIs** created right in the web portal.

In the web portal you can browse the report server folders or search for specific reports. You can view a report, its general properties and past copies of the report that are captured in report history. Depending on your permissions, you might also be able to subscribe to reports for delivery to your e-mail inbox or a shared folder on the file system.

For this quickstart, you need an Azure subscription. If you don’t have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
