## Auguast 2018

 August 2018 sees many new features added to the version of Power BI Desktop optimized for Power BI Report Server. Here they are, broken out by area:

[Reporting]()
[Analytics]()
[Modeling]()

Out of the whole long list of new features, these stand out as especially interesting.

#### [Report theming](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/power-bi-report-server-update-august-2018/preview/#theming) 

#### [Conditional formatting improvements](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/power-bi-report-server-update-august-2018/preview/#conditionalFormattingField)

### [Report page tooltips](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/power-bi-report-server-update-august-2018/preview/#tableTooltips)

### Reporting

#### Report Theming

We are very excited to announce we’ve added report theming to this release of Power BI Report Server, which will allow you to quickly color your entire report to match a theme or corporate branding. When you import a theme, all your charts will automatically update to use the theme colors, and you’ll have access to the theme colors from the color palette.
You can upload a theme file using the Import Theme option under the Switch Theme button.

A theme file is a JSON file that includes all the colors you want us to use in your report along with any default formatting you want to apply to visuals.
Here is a simple sample JSON theme that just updates the default colors of the report:

```json
{
"name": "waveform",
"dataColors": [ "#31B6FD", "#4584D3", "#5BD078", "#A5D028", "#F5C040", "#05E0DB", "#3153FD", "#4C45D3", "#5BD0B0", "#54D028", "#D0F540", "#057BE0" ],
"background":"#FFFFFF",
"foreground": "#F2F2F2",
"tableAccent":"#5BD078"
}
```

When the theme is uploaded, the colors will automatically be applied to all charts.

You’ll also see the colors in the color palette, so you will be able to use them in other places as well.

Applied theme colors will follow your reports when you save them to Power BI Report Server.
If you are looking for some examples to get started, you can download the theme I used in this example, a theme that is more color blind user friendly than our default, or if you are feeling nostalgic, a zip file of all the Power View themes. You can find other themes or submit your own theme on our report theme gallery in the Power BI Community. You can also read our documentation to learn more about all the properties you can control through theming.

#### Buttons to trigger actions

Now that we have several different actions that can be triggered by just a click on a shape or image, we decided it was time to add a button control to Power BI as well. These new buttons are geared towards letting you create an app-like experience with interactive elements in your report.
A button can be inserted from the ribbon, by picking on of several icons or selecting a blank button. Once on your page, you can choose to add text, change the icon, add a fill color or give your button an outline. You have lots of control around the look of the icon and text including size, color, and alignment. Once you pick your default look for your button, you can then use the dropdown to change how it looks on hover or when it is being clicked on.

As with images and shapes, you can pick the action that will be performed on click through the Action card. Currently these actions include ‘back’ and a specific bookmark. For certain icon types, we will have a default action assigned.

#### Combo chart line styles

You can now change your combo chart lines to different styles and have that optionally reflected in your legend.

#### Improved default sort for visuals

One of our goals is to make it fast and easy for you to create beautiful, well formatted reports. We’ve improved our default visual sort, so you won’t need to change it nearly as frequently.
Our new logic for sorting visuals is:
1.	If your visual uses a column that has an associated order-by column, we will sort by that by default (you can set this up using the Sort by column feature)
2.	Otherwise, if your field is a date field, we will sort in chronological order
3.	Lastly, if you don’t have an order-by column or date field, we will sort by the measure descending.
Of course, as always we will always respect any sort order you manually pick.

#### Numeric range slicer
The numeric range is generally available to use, and therefore, is now part of the Power BI Desktop for Report Server. You’ll see it a slicer type option for numeric column without needing to turn on a preview feature. Additionally, any newly created slicers using numeric columns will default to the between mode of the numeric range slicer. 

#### Advanced slicer syncing
The Advanced section of Slicer syncing pane allows you to create custom groups of slicers to sync. By default synced slicers will be put a group with a name that matches the field used in the slicer but you can override this with any name you want. This means you can create separate groups to sync slicers that use the same field; for example you’ve got two slicers using the same field on the same page, and you want to sync one of them with a slicer on another page.
You can also put slicers that use different fields in the same group; for example you’ve got two different date fields and you want to have the selected date sync between the slicers. If the value selected in the first slicer doesn’t exist in the second slicer, you’ll see it appear at the bottom of the list of values.

You can also check the Sync field changes to other slicers. With this option checked, if you swap the field used in the slicer, all the synced slicers will update to use the same field.

#### Log axis improvements

We’ve greatly improved log axis in your cartesian charts.
You should now be able to select log scale for the numeric axis of any cartesian chart, including combo chart, when you have data that is completely positive or completely negative. Reference lines should also observe the log scale and will cause the scale to resize to accommodate them.

If you have data that crosses zero, you’ll now get a helpful warning in the property pane, and the scale type will revert to linear. Once your data is updated to no longer include both positive and negative values, the visual will start to use the log axis again.

#### Data label options for funnel chart

We've added more control for data labels in funnel chart. You can now pick if each bar shows the actual value, the percentage of the first bar, the percentage of the previous bar, or the actual value and one of the two percentage options.

The first bar will always show only the data value since the percentages are always 100%.

#### Set line stroke width to zero

Another small formatting option we added is the ability to set the stroke width of lines to 0.

This works for combo charts as well as line charts.

#### High contrast support for reports

If you're using the high contrast mode Windows settings, your Power BI reports will now respect the color palette you're using. When using Power BI Desktop, we'll automatically detect which high contrast theme you're using and apply those colors across your report, similar to the experience you're used to with other Microsoft products, such as Excel.

In Power BI Report Server, we'll also try to detect which theme you're using and automatically apply it to your report, but depending on what browser you are using, we may not be able to. If you want to change the theme manually, you can select a high contrast theme under the View dropdown.

Note that if you're using high contrast themes on Power BI Desktop, you’ll still see some areas of the product that aren't using your theme’s colors. We’ll be adding more support for high contrast in future releases.

#### Donut radius control

We’ve added the ability to control the inner radius of your donut chart. This lets you make the donut slimmer or thicker to get the style you want. You’ll find this option under the Shapes card in the formatting pane.

#### Pie & Donut detail labels position

Pie and donut charts now support moving your detail labels inside. You can pick between forcing the labels to always be outside or inside or to prefer one position over the other.

If you choose to move your labels inside the pie or donut chart, you can also choose whether the text can overflow past the edge of the shape and if the labels have a background or not.

#### Format data labels separately for each measure in a combo chart

There’s an update to data labels in combo charts in this release. Now you can customize individual series. In the Data labels card of the formatting pane, you can turn the Customize series option on to format an individual measure’s formatting options, such as color, display units, and the number of decimal points.

#### New visual header with more flexibility and formatting

A common request we’ve heard from report authors was that the visual’s header took up a lot of space and that it didn’t fit with the design of their reports. Based off this feedback, we have completely revamped our visual header.
Since the new visual header is detached from the visual, it can adapt its position based on the layout of the visual. By default, the header will appear inside the visual in line with the title.

If your visual doesn’t have a title, it will instead float on top of the visual, unless the visual is all the way to the top of the report, in which case it snaps to the bottom of the visual.

Every visual now has a new card in the formatting pane, called visual header. In this card, you’ll find options to format the icon color, the background and border colors, and their transparency. You can also choose to turn off individual icons or the whole header for viewers of your report.

Note that the visibility toggles do not affect your report when authoring it. You’ll need to publish your report and view it in reading mode to see the effect. This is because many of the options in the visual header are important during editing, especially the warning icons.
This new visual header is on by default for all new reports. For existing reports, you will need to enable it in the Options dialog under the Report settings section. Depending on your report’s layout, you may notice some shifts after upgrading reports to the new header, especially with background images.

#### Wallpaper formatting

With our new wallpaper feature, we now let you format that grey area outside your report page. This lets you theme the entire report area and gives it a more cohesive feel. The formatting options you have are similar to what you currently have for report pages, including color, transparency, and uploading an image. You can set the wallpaper per page or use our theming feature to set a new default experience for all your report pages.
This feature can be used to extend the main color of any background images you are using for layouts to the rest of the space.

You can also make your report page transparent and have your charts float on top of the wallpaper.

Which can give your report a very different feeling depending on the image used.

You’ll notice that when the page background has a transparency higher that 50%, we’ll add a grey dotted line in editing mode to help you see where the edge of your page is.
As part of this update, we’re also updating the default report page experience to have a completely transparent page background and a white wallpaper, which has a nicer feeling than a white page and grey wallpaper.

#### Tooltips for table & matrix

Based on the interest we heard from the community, we decided to close the gap between table and matrix and other visuals in terms of tooltips. We now support the standard tooltips on both the table and matrix visuals.
You’ll be able to turn tooltips on for table and matrix using the new tooltip card. Tooltips will be default to off, so you don’t need to worry about your reports changing without you knowing.

Once the tooltip card is turned to on, you’ll get the standard Power BI tooltip for your visual.

#### Turn tooltips off for visuals

While we are making updates to tooltips to support table and matrix, we also added the same on/off toggle for tooltips all visuals that support tooltips. If you go to the same tooltip card you use to control report page tooltips, you’ll see a toggle has been added to the card. If you turn the toggle off, you’ll receive no tooltip at all when hovering over the visual.

#### Slicer accessibility

Being able to interact with and change slicer values is one of the most important tasks for any report consumer, and for a while this wasn’t available to users who relied solely on a keyboard to navigate. We’re very happy to announce that keyboard and screen reader users can now go beyond consuming a report as is and can start interacting with slicers on their reports.
When you want to explore the current state of a slicer using just a keyboard, the first thing you’ll need to do is enter into the slicer. You can do this with the Ctrl+Right Arrow keyboard shor0tcut. This will move your focus to the first element inside the slicer. You can then tab around the various components of the slicer, such as the clear icon, dropdowns and text fields to update values, and the slicer type dropdown. As your focus moves, helpful information is also read out by the screen reader, if you have one on.
This is a big step forward in terms of accessibility and we have even more accessibility features planned for the coming months.

#### Formatting pane improvements

If you are a report author, you probably spend a lot of time in our formatting pane updating the design of your visuals. Given its usage and the fact that it was originally designed when we didn’t have very many formatting options available, we’ve been wanting to revamp it for quite a while. Luckily, we recently had a new developer join our team, so as an introductory task, we had her update the style of our formatting pane.
The updates include:

- A lighter grey color used inside cards, so the entire pane doesn’t blend together
- Animations and hover effects give the pane a more modern and polished feel
-  Titles show above a given control to improve readability and reduce truncation

These updates should make the time you spend in the formatting pane a little bit nicer!

#### Stepped line support in line and combo charts

As a small formatting improvement, we now support changing the line in combo charts to a stepped format. You’ll find this toggle in the Shapes card. The type of stepped line we currently support changes height at the midpoint between two data points.

#### Sorting experience improvement

We’ve found through user testing that our sort experience wasn’t very clear or easy to use and wasn’t accessible to keyboard users. We've improved this by separating the controls to change sort direction from the control to pick the field to sort by. With this change, you can now also fully navigate this options flyout using only a keyboard.

#### Print reports through Export to PDF

We’ve heard loud and clear from you that we needed an option in Power BI Desktop to easily print or email copies of your reports out to others in your company. We’ve been working on a solution to this problem for awhile now and are glad to share that with this month’s update you can now export all visible report pages to PDF. You’ll find this new option under the File menu.

Once you select Export to PDF, we will start generating the PDF. While we’re doing this, we’ll show you a dialog letting you know we are working on it, and you’ll see each non-hidden page loading in order behind it. During this process, you won’t be able to interact with the report. If you need to interact with your report again before we’ve finished you can cancel the export through the dialog.

Once the PDF has been created, it will open in your default PDF viewer, which in my case is Microsoft Edge. From there you can save it wherever you like, email it as an attachment, or print it!
  
Currently, we don’t support printing wallpaper color or images, only page backgrounds or images. If you have a dark wallpaper color and a transparent page color, you may want to temporarily set the page background to match the wallpaper’s color to improve readability.

#### Create bookmark groups

If you are using bookmarks extensively, you like have sets of bookmarks with different purposes. For example, you may have different bookmarks per organizational division using your report, or perhaps you have a set of bookmarks for navigation and several sets of bookmarks for different presentations.
In these cases, it’s important to clearly separate out each group of bookmarks, and this month, based on your feedback, we’ve made this much easier to do with the introduction of bookmarking grouping. Bookmark grouping lets you collect a set of bookmarks together and give it a name. Each group can be expanded and collapsed for easy viewing.

To create a bookmark group, click the first bookmark of the group and then ctrl+click the other bookmarks you want to group with it. Then select the “…” menu for any of the bookmarks to group and pick the group option.

If you decide later you don't want that group anymore, just use Ungroup to stop grouping that set of bookmarks.

When you use View to play a bookmark group, it will only include the bookmarks in that group.

Playing from a bookmark at the root level, such as Default View in this example, will still play through all bookmarks in your pane.
Slicer restatement
If you are using the list slicer, you can now add a restatement, similar to the restatement in the dropdown slicer, to the slicer header through an option in the Slicer header card in the formatting pane.
 
Report page tooltips
We are very excited to announce that our report page tooltips feature is included in this update of Power BI Report Server. This feature lets you design a report page to be used as a custom tooltip for other visuals in your report. This gives you full flexibility to design whatever kind of custom tooltips you want, from using cards to show detailed information to miniature drillthrough pages shown on hover.
To start creating your custom report page tooltips, first you have to design the tooltip you want to show. We recommend you use a smaller page size, so you don’t have to worry about the tooltip being too large to show on your normal report pages. We have added a new page size template called Tooltip to use as a starting point, but you can use any page size you want.
 
While designing your tooltip, we recommend viewing it in Actual size, so you know exactly what your tooltip will look like on hover.
 
Once you’ve finished creating your tooltip report page, you’ll need to mark the page as a tooltip so we know you want to use it as such.
 
From here, there are two ways you can start using this tooltip in your report. The first is to tie it to a specific field using the Tooltip fields bucket below the Filters pane. This behaves similarly to the drillthrough fields bucket. Any fields you put into the tooltip fields bucket will be tied to this tooltip. If you use this field in charts throughout your report, this tooltip will be used instead of the default Power BI tooltip. You can put both categorical and numerical fields in this bucket, including measures.
For example, if I put SalesAmount in the Tooltip fields bucket…
 
That page will be used as a tooltip in other visuals using the SalesAmount field.
 
The other way you can tie a custom tooltip page to your visuals is to manually set it through the Tooltip card in the formatting pane. In the card, you can set any page that’s marked as a Tooltip page, even if it doesn’t have anything in the Tooltip field bucket, to be the tooltip for this visual. This is useful if you want to design a tooltip to be used for a specific visual.
 
Another use case is to manually override the automatically selected tooltip if we picked the wrong one to use. For example, in the chart above, if I had one tooltip tied to the Units field and one tied to the Category field (the two fields used to create the chart), we’d pick one of these tooltips to use automatically. If you didn’t like the tooltip we picked, you can use this manual override to pick the other one.
If you manually override the tooltip in this card, you can always go back to our “automatic” selection by selecting Auto in the dropdown list. You can also completely turn the report page tooltips off for a chart by setting the tooltip type dropdown to Default. This will force a chart to use Power BI’s default tooltip, even if there are matching report page tooltips in the report.
 
There are a couple of other things to consider when building report page tooltips. First, when using these custom tooltips for line charts, you will only get one tooltip for all lines in the chart, as you do today. The field in the legend does not get passed through as a filter on the tooltip. In the example below, the tooltip is showing all units sold on that day across all three classes: Deluxe, Economy, and Regular.
 
Second, when a chart is being cross-highlighted, the report page tooltips will always show the cross-highlighted data, even if you are hovering over the “faded out” section of the data point. To see the unfiltered data in the tooltip, you will need to clear the highlighting.

## October 2017 release

### Power BI report data sources

Power BI reports in Power BI Report Server can connect to a variety of data sources. You can import data and schedule data refresh, or query it directly using DirectQuery or a live connection to SQL Server Analysis Services. See the list of data sources that support scheduled refresh and those that support DirectQuery in "Power BI report data sources in Power BI Report Server".

### Scheduled data refresh for imported data

In Power BI Report Server, you can set up scheduled data refresh to keep data up to date in Power BI reports with an embedded model rather than a live connection or DirectQuery. With an embedded model you import the data, so it's disconnected from the original data source. It needs to be updated to keep the data fresh, and scheduled refresh is the way to do that. Read more about "scheduled refresh for Power BI reports in Power BI Report Server".

### Editing Power BI reports from the server

You can open and edit Power BI report (.pbix) files from the server, but you get back the original file you uploaded.  This means **if the data has been refreshed by the server, the data won’t be refreshed when you first open the file**. You need to manually refresh it locally to see the change.

### Large file upload/download

You can upload files up to 2 GB in size, though by default this limit is set to 1 GB in the Report Server settings in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).  These files are stored in the database just as they are for SharePoint, and no special configuration for the SQL Server catalog is required.  

### Accessing shared datasets as OData feeds

You can access shared datasets from Power BI Desktop with an OData feed. For more information, see [Accessing shared datasets as OData feeds in Power BI Report Server](access-dataset-odata.md).

### Scale-out

This release supports scale-out. Use a load-balancer and set server affinity for the best experience. Note that the scenario is not yet optimized for scale-out, so you'll see models potentially replicated across multiple nodes. The scenario will work without the Network Load Balancer and sticky sessions. However, you'll not only see an over-use of memory across nodes as the model is loaded N times, but performance will slow in between connections as the model is streamed as it hits a new node in between requests.  

### Administrator settings

Administrators can set the following properties in SSMS Advanced Properties for the server farm:

* EnableCustomVisuals: True/False
* EnablePowerBIReportEmbeddedModels: True/False
* EnablePowerBIReportExportData: True/False
* MaxFileSizeMb: Default is now 1000
* ModelCleanupCycleMinutes: How often it checks to evict models from memory
* ModelExpirationMinutes: How long until model expires and is evicted, based on last time used
* ScheduleRefreshTimeoutMinutes: How long data refresh can take for a model. By default, this is two hours.  There is no hard upper limit.

**Config file rsreportserver.config**

```
<Configuration>
  <Service>
    <PollingInterval>10</PollingInterval>
    <IsDataModelRefreshService>false</IsDataModelRefreshService>
    <MaxQueueThreads>0</MaxQueueThreads>
  </Service>
</Configuration>
```

### Developer API

The developer API (REST API) introduced for SSRS 2017 has been extended for Power BI Report Server to work with both Excel files and .pbix files. One potential use case is to programmatically download files from the server, refresh them, and then republish them. This is the only way to refresh Excel workbooks with PowerPivot models, for example.

Note that there is a new separate API for large files, which will be updated in the Power BI Report Server version of Swagger. 

### SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) and the Power BI Report Server memory footprint

Power BI Report Server now hosts SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) internally. This isn't specific to scheduled refresh. Hosting SSAS can greatly expand the report server memory footprint. The AS.ini configuration file is available on the server nodes, so if you're familiar with SSAS, you may want to update the settings, including maximum memory limit and disk caching etc. See [Server properties in Analysis Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/analysis-services/server-properties/server-properties-in-analysis-services) for details.

### Viewing and interacting with Excel workbooks

Excel and Power BI contain a portfolio of tools that is unique in the industry. Together, they enable business analysts to more easily gather, shape, analyze, and visually explore their data. In addition to viewing Power BI reports in the web portal, business users can now do the same with Excel workbooks in Power BI Report Server, giving them a single location to publish and view their self-service Microsoft BI content.

We’ve published a [walkthrough of how to add Office Online Server (OOS) to your Power BI Report Server preview environment](excel-oos.md). Customers with a Volume Licensing account can download OOS from the Volume License Servicing Center at no cost and will have view-only functionality. Once configured, users can view and interact with Excel workbooks that:

* Have no external data source dependencies
* Have a live connection to an external SQL Server Analysis Services data source
* Have a PowerPivot data model

### Support for new table and matrix visuals

Power BI Report Server now supports the new Power BI table and matrix visuals. To create reports with these visuals, you will need an updated Power BI Desktop release for the October 2017 release. It can't be installed side-by-side with the Power BI Desktop (June 2017) release. For the latest version of Power BI Desktop, on the [Power BI Report Server download page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/report-server/), select **Advanced download options**.

## June 2017

* Power BI Report Server made generally available (GA).

## May 2017
