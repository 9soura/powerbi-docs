# Paginated report (.rdl) data sources
Reporting Services paginated reports in Power BI Report Server support the same data sources that are supported in SQL Server Reporting Services. See the list of [Data sources supported by Reporting Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/reporting-services/report-data/data-sources-supported-by-reporting-services-ssrs).

## Next steps
Now that you've connected to your data source, [create a paginated report](quickstart-create-paginated-report.md).
