# The new Filters experience in Power BI reports (Preview)

This article spells out the new filter experience: Filters in Power BI are getting new functionality and a new design. When you design reports in Power BI Desktop and in the Power BI service, you can make the Filters pane to look like and act with the whole report. In the new experience, the old Filters pane acts as a filter editing pane, and the new Filter pane is the only one your report consumers see.
 
Default view (no additional customization applied)

As a report designer, here's what you can do with the new filters:

- Show a read-only view of filters in the visual header, so consumers know exactly what filters or slicers are affecting a given visual.
- Format and customize the filter pane so that it feels part of your report.
- Define whether the Filters pane is open or collapsed by default when a consumer opens the report.
- Hide the entire filter pane or specific filters that you don’t want report consumers to see.
- Control and even bookmark the visibility, open, and collapsed state of the new filter pane.
- Lock filters that you don’t want consumers to edit.

## Turn on the new filter experience 

### Turn on new filters for all new reports

Because this new filter experience is in Preview, you must first enable it in Power BI Desktop. 

1. Select **File** > **Options and Settings** > **Options** > **Preview Features**, then select the **New filter experience** checkbox. 
2. Restart Power BI Desktop to see the new filter experience in all new reports.

After you enable the new filter experience, it's enabled  by default for all new reports you create.  

### Turn on new filters for an existing report

You can also enable the new filters for existing reports.

1. In an existing report, select **File** > **Options and Settings** > **Options** > **Report settings**. 
2. Restart Power BI Desktop to see the new filter experience in this report.
 
After you restart Power BI Desktop, you can start working with the filter editing pane and the read-only filter pane.

## Build the new filter pane

After you enable the new filter pane, you see it to the right of the report page, formatted by default based on your current report settings. The old filter pane now acts as the filter editing pane. The new filter pane shows you what your report consumers will see when you publish your report. You can update existing filters in the new pane, but you use the older filter pane to configure which filters to include.

1. First decide if you want your report consumers to see the filter pane. If you want them to see it, select the eye icon ![Eye icon](media/power-bi-report-filter-preview/power-bi-filter-off-eye-icon.png) next to Filters.

2. To start building your new filter pane, drag fields of interest into the filter editing pane either as visual, page, or report level filters. You see them in the new Filters pane.

## Lock or hide filters

You can lock or hide individual filter cards. If you lock a filter, your report consumers can see but not change it. If you hide it, they can't even see it. Hiding filter cards is typically useful if you need to hide data cleanup filters that exclude nulls or unexpected values. 

- In the filter editing pane, select or clear the **Lock filter** or **Hide filter** icons in a filter card.

As you turn these settings on and off in the filter editing pane, you see the changes reflected in the new filter pane. Note that hidden filters will not show up in read only per visual filter pop-up.
 
## Formatting the new filter pane

When building your filter pane, you can also configure your filter pane state to flow with your report bookmarks. The pane’s open, close, and visibility state are all bookmarkable.
 

A big part of this new experience is that you can now format the filter pane to match the look and feel of your report.
Report authors can format the following for the filter pane: 
•	Background color of the filter pane
•	Background transparency
•	Filter pane border on or off
•	Filter pane border color

 

Report authors can format the following for the applied (when the filter is set to something) and available (when filter is cleared) filter cards: 
•	Background color
•	Background transparency
•	Border: on or off
•	Border color
  

Read only view of filters per visual

This will enable report consumers to know what filters, slicers, cross filters etc. are affecting a visual. The formatting of the edit pop-up will be inherited from the filter pane formatting.

Here’s are the following types of filters captured in this view: 
•	Basic filters
•	Slicers
•	Cross-highlight 
•	Cross-filter
•	Advanced filters
•	Top N filters
•	Relative Date filters
•	Sync-slicers
•	Include/Exclude filters
•	Filters passed through URL

Coming soon

We have plans to incorporate the following improvements in coming months… 
•	Ability to change the order of filter cards
•	Single filter pane experience for report creators 
•	More formatting options
Give the new filter experience a try and provide us your feedback for this feature and how we can continue to improve this experience!
