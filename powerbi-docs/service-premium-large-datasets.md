# Power BI Premium support for large datasets

Power BI Premium now supports datasets up to 10 GB. To use a large dataset, publish it to a workspace that has been assigned to Premium capacity. Everything else stays the same, and all other Power BI features work as expected.
 
## Best practices

This section describes best practices for working with large datasets.

- Large models can be very resource-intensive on your capacity; we recommend at least a P1 SKU for any models larger than 1 GB. The following table describes which SKU is recommended for various .pbix sizes:


|SKU  |Size of .pbix   |
|---------|---------|
|P1     | < 3 GB        |
|P2     | < 6 GB        |
|P3     | up to 10 GB   |



- Your .pbix files represent data in a highly compressed state. The data will likely expand several times when loaded in memory, and from there it may expand several more times during data refresh.

- Scheduled refresh of large datasets can take long periods of time and be very resource-intensive. Accordingly, do not schedule too many overlapping refreshes. Notice also that the timeout for schedule refresh jobs has been doubled to four hours for all datasets in this capacity.

- The initial report load of large datasets may take some time if it has been a while since the last time the dataset was used, because the model is loaded into memory of your Premium capacity. A loading bar for longer-loading reports indicates the load progress.

- If you remove the workspace from Premium capacity, the model and all associated reports and dashboards will not work.

- While the per-query memory and time constraints are much higher in Premium capacity, it is highly recommended you use filters and slicers to limit visuals to display only what is necessary.
