In Power BI, customers and developers are able to extend the number of data sources that can be connected to in a variety of ways. While we offer the ability to connect to a variety of generic data sources (ODBC, OData, Oledb, Web, CSV, XML, JSON), we also offer the ability for developers to create data extensions that we call 'Custom Connectors', as well as certify them to make them 'Certified Connectors'.

Custom Connectors can include a wide range of possibilities ranging from small APIs that are critical to your business, to largest industry specific services that we haven't implemented. Most of these connectors will be distributed by the vendor themselves, and if there's one you need, you should reach out to the vendor.

In older versions of Power BI, the ability to use these 'Custom Connectors' was enabled via a feature switch. We now have a menu to allow you to securely control what level of custom code you want to be willing to run on your system: all custom connectors, or just ones certified ones distributed by Microsoft via the "Get Data" dialogue.
