# Use the Matrix visual in Power BI

With the **Matrix** visual feature, you can create matrix visuals (sometimes also referred to as *tables*) and cross-highlight elements within the matrix with other visuals. This feature is available in **Power BI Desktop** and **Power BI service** reports. In the matrix, you can select rows, columns, and even individual cells and cross-highlight them. You'll have the ability to copy and paste individual cells and multiple cell selections into other applications. Lastly, to make better use of layout space, the matrix visual supports a stepped layout.

There are many features associated with the matrix, and we'll go through them in the following sections of this article.

## Report themes

Both matrix and table visuals reflect styling (including colors) from the applied **Report Theme**. These may not be the colors you expect for your matrix visual, which you can change in your **Report Theme** configuration. For more info, see [**Use Report Themes in Power BI Desktop**](../desktop-report-themes.md).

## Understanding how Power BI calculates totals

Before jumping into how to use the **Matrix** visual, it's important to learn how Power BI calculates total and subtotal values in tables and matrices. For total and subtotal rows, Power BI evaluates the measure over all rows in the underlying data – it isn't just a simple addition of the values in the visible or displayed rows. This means you can end up with different values in the total row than you might expect.

Take a look at the following **Matrix** visuals.

![Screenshot showing Matrix visuals.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_3.png)

Each row in the **Matrix** visual farthest to the right is showing the *Sum of Amount* for each **Date** and **Salesperson** combination. Since a salesperson shows up against multiple dates, there's more than one **Sum of Amount** value for David and Gentiana. The accurate total from the underlying data, and a simple addition of the visible values, don't equate. This inequity is a common pattern when the value you’re summing is the *one* of a one-to-many relationship.

When you look at totals and subtotals, remember that those values are based on the underlying data. They aren't solely based on the visible values.

## Expanding and collapsing row headers
There are two ways you can expand row headers. The first is through the right-click menu. You’ll see options to expand the specific row header you clicked on, the entire level or everything down to the very last level of the hierarchy. You have similar options for collapsing row headers as well.

![](media/desktop-matrix-visual/power-bi-expand1.png)

You can also add +/- buttons to the row headers through the formatting pane under the row headers card. By default, the icons will match the formatting of the row header, but you can customize the icons’ color and size separately if you want. 
Once the icons are turned on, they work similarly to the icons from PivotTables in Excel.

![](media/desktop-matrix-visual/power-bi-expand2.png)

The expansion state of the matrix will save with your report. It can be pinned to dashboards as well, but consumers will need to open up the report to change the state. Conditional formatting will only apply to the inner most visible level of the hierarchy. Note that this expand/collapse experience is not currently supported when connecting to AS servers older than 2016 or MD servers.

## Using drill down with the Matrix visual

With the **Matrix** visual, you can do all sorts of interesting drill down activities that weren't available before. You can drill down into rows, columns, and even into individual sections and cells. Let's take a look at how each of these works.

### Drill down on row headers

In the **Visualizations** pane, when you add multiple fields to the **Rows** section of the **Fields** well, you enable drill down on the rows of the matrix visual. This is similar to creating a hierarchy. Now you can drill down (and then back up) through that hierarchy, and analyze the data at each level.

In the following screenshot, the **Rows** section has *Category* and *SubCategory*, creating a grouping (or hierarchy) in the rows that we can drill through.

![Screenshot of the Visuals and Fields panes with an arrow pointing at the Rows well.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_4.png)

When the visual has grouping created in the **Rows** section, the visual itself shows the *drill* and *expand* icons in the top-left corner of the Matrix visual.

![Screenshot of the Matrix visual with an arrow pointing at the drill and expand icons.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_5.png)

Similar to the drill and expand behavior in other visuals, selecting those buttons lets us drill down (or back up) through the hierarchy. In this case, we can drill down from *Category* to *SubCategory*, as shown in the following screenshot, where the user selected the drill down one level icon (the pitchfork).

![Screenshot of the Matrix visual with an arrow pointing at the subcategory.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_6.png)

You can also right-click on any of those row headers and drill down by selecting from the menu that appears.

![Screenshot of the right-click menu with Drill Down being selected.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_7.png)

Notice there are a few options from the menu that appears, which generate different results:

Selecting **Drill Down** expands the matrix for *that* row level, *excluding* all other row headings except the row header that was right-clicked. In the following screenshot, the user right-clicked *Computers*, and selected **Drill Down**. Notice that other top-level rows no longer appear in the matrix. This way to drill is a useful feature, and becomes especially cool when we get to the **cross-highlighting** section.

![Screenshot of the Matrix visual showing only the Computers category and its subcategories.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_8.png)

You can click the **Drill up** icon to get back to the previous top-level view. If you then select **Show Next Level** from the right-click menu, you get an alphabetical listing of all the next-level items (in this case, the *SubCategory* field), without the higher-level hierarchy categorization.

![Screenshot of two visuals showing what happens when you select Show Next Level.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_8a.png)

When you click on the **Drill up** icon in the upper-left corner to have the matrix show all top-level categories, then right-click again and select **Expand to next level**, you see the following visual.

![Screenshot of two visuals showing what happens when you select Expand to next level.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_9.png)

You can also use the **Include** and **Exclude** menu items to keep (or remove, respectively) the right-clicked row (and any subcategories) from the matrix.

### Drill down on column headers

Similar to the ability to drill down on **Rows**, you can also drill down on **Columns**. In the following screenshot, you can see that there are two fields in the **Columns** field well, creating a hierarchy similar to what we used for the rows earlier in this article. In the **Columns** field well, we have *Class* and *Color*.

![Screenshot of the Matrix visual and its corresponding Visualizations pane with an arrow pointing to the Columns well.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_10.png)

In the **Matrix** visual, when we right-click a column, we see the option to drill down. In the following screenshot, we right-click on *Deluxe* and select **Drill Down**.

![Screenshot of the Matrix visual with an arrow pointing from the Deluxe column header to Drill Down in the right-click menu.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_11.png)

When you select **Drill Down**, the next level of the column hierarchy for *Deluxe* displays, which in this case is *Color*.

![Screenshot of the Matrix visual with one arrow pointing to Deluxe and another pointing to the row of colors.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_12.png)

The rest of the right-click menu items work on columns in the same way they do for rows (see the previous section, **Drill down on row headers**). You can **Show Next Level**, **Expand to next level**, **Include**, or **Exclude** your columns just as you can with rows.

> [!NOTE]
> The drill down and drill up icons in the upper-left of the matrix visual only apply to rows. In order to drill down on columns, you must use the right-click menu.

## Stepped layout with matrix visuals

The **Matrix** visual automatically indents subcategories in a hierarchy beneath each parent, called a **Stepped layout**.

In the *original* version of the matrix visual, Power BI showed subcategories in an entirely different column, taking up much more space in the visual. The following screenshot shows the table in original **Matrix** visual; notice the subcategories in a separate column.

![Screenshot of the old Matrix visual showing the subcatagories in a separate column.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_14.png)

In the following screenshot, you see a **Matrix** visual, with **Stepped layout** in action. Notice the category *Computers* has its subcategories (Computers Accessories, Desktops, Laptops, Monitors, and so on) slightly indented, providing a cleaner and much more condensed visual.

![Screenshot of the new Matrix visual showing the subcatagories in the stepped layout under the related category.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_13.png)

You can easily adjust the stepped layout settings. With the **Matrix** visual selected, in the **Format** section (the paint roller icon) of the **Visualizations** pane, expand the **Row headers** section. You have two options: the **Stepped layout** toggle (which turns it on or off), and the **Stepped layout indentation** (specifies the indentation amount, in pixels).

![Screenshot of the Matrix visual and the Format section with four arrows pointing to the Paint Roller icon, the Row headers drop-down, ant the Stepped layout and the Stepped layout indentation options.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_15.png)

If you turn off **Stepped layout**, Power BI shows the subcategories in another column rather than indented beneath the parent category.

## Subtotals with matrix visuals

You can turn subtotals on or off in matrix visuals, for both rows and columns. In the following screenshot, you can see that the row subtotals are set to **on**.

![Screenshot of the Matrix visual with the subtotals turned on.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_20.png)

In the **Format** section of the **Visualizations** pane, expand the **Subtotals** card, and turn the **Row subtotals** slider to **Off**. When you do so, the subtotals aren't shown.

![Screenshot of the Matrix visual with the subtotals turned off.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_21.png)

The same process applies for column subtotals.

## Cross-highlighting with matrix visuals

With the **Matrix** visual, you can select any elements in the matrix as the basis for cross-highlighting. Select a column in a **Matrix** and Power BI highlights the column, as does any other visuals on the report page. This type of cross-highlighting has been a common feature of other visuals and data point selections, so now the **Matrix** visual offers the same function.

Also use Ctrl+Click for cross-highlighting. For example, in the following screenshot the user selected a collection of subcategories from the **Matrix** visual. Notice how items that weren't selected from the visual are not available, and how the other visuals on the page reflect the selections made in the **Matrix** visual.

![Screenshot of the Matrix visual along with two other visuals demonstrating the Ctrl+Click function for cross-highlighting.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_16.png)

## Copying values from Power BI for use in other applications

Your matrix or table may have content that you'd like to use in other applications: Dynamics CRM, Excel, and other Power BI reports. With the Power BI right-click, you can copy a single cell or a selection of cells onto your clipboard. Then, paste them into the other application.

* To copy the value of a single cell, select the cell,  right-click, and choose **Copy value**. With the unformatted cell value on your clipboard, you can now paste it into another application.

    ![Screenshot of the Matrix visual with an arrow pointing to a value and the right-click menu expanded with the Copy value and Copy selection options called out.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/power-bi-cell-copy.png)

* To copy more than a single cell, select a range of cells or use CTRL to select one or more cells.

    ![Screenshot of the Matrix visual with an arrow pointing from three called out values to the right-click menu expanded with the Copy value and Copy selection options called out.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/power-bi-copy.png)

* The copy will include the column and row headers.

    ![Screenshot showing Excel rows and columns with the values pasted into them.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/power-bi-copy-selection.png)

## Shading and font colors with matrix visuals

With the **Matrix** visual, you can apply **Conditional formatting** (colors and shading) to the background of cells within the matrix. You can also apply conditional formatting to the text and values themselves.

To apply conditional formatting, you can do either of the following after you select a matrix visual:

* In the **Fields** pane, right-click the Field, and select **Conditional formatting** from the menu.
  
  ![Screenshot of the Matrix visual depicting how to get to the Conditional formatting menu.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_17.png)

* Or, in the **Format** pane, expand the **Conditional formatting** card and for either **Background color scales** or **Font color scales**, turn the slider to **On**. Turning on either option shows a link for *Advanced controls*, which lets you customize the colors and values for the color formatting.
  
  ![Screenshot of the Matrix visual depicting how to adjust Conditional formatting from the Format pane.](media/desktop-matrix-visual/matrix-visual_18.png)

Either approach achieves the same result. Selecting *Advanced controls* shows the following dialog, which lets you make adjustments:
