# Creating a report on a SharePoint List

Many teams and organizations use Lists in SharePoint Online to store data since it is easy to set up and for users to update.  Sometimes a chart is a much easier way for users to quickly understand the data rather than looking at the list itself.  In this tutorial, we will show you how to transform your SharePoint List data into a Power BI Report.

Watch a 5 minute tutorial video or scroll down for step-by-step instructions.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

### Part 1: Connect to your SharePoint List

1. If you don't have it already, download and install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/).
2. Open Power BI Desktop and in the Home tab of the ribbon, click *Get Data*. Click *More*.

3. Click *Online Services* on the left, then click *SharePoint Online list*.  Click *Connect*.
4. Find the address (also known as a URL) of your SharePoint Online site that contains your list.  From a page in SharePoint Online, you can usually get to the site address by clicking "Home" in the left navigation or the icon for the site at the top, then copying the address from your web browser's address bar.

10. Click *Load*.  Power BI will load your list data into a new report.

### Part 2: Create a report

1. On the left hand side, click the *Data* icon to see your SharePoint list data that was loaded.

2. Make sure your list columns with numbers show the Sum icon in the list on the right hand side of the screen.  For any that don't, fix this by clicking the column header in the table view, clicking the *Modeling* tab, then changing the Data type dropdown to Decimal Number or Whole Number, depending on your situation.  If prompted to confirm your change, click *Yes*.  If your number is a special format, like currency, you can also choose that by setting the 'Format'.
