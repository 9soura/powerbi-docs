# Report authoring concepts in Power BI Report Builder
  This section briefly defines some key concepts used to describe paginated reports  in the Report Builder and Report Designer documentation.  
  
   
  
## In This Section  
 [Reports, Report Parts, and Report Definitions &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/reports-report-parts-and-report-definitions-report-builder-and-ssrs.md)  
 Describes the variety of terms used to describe a report in different states, including the initial definition, the published report, and the viewed report as it appears to the user.  
  
 [Embedded and Shared Datasets &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-data/embedded-and-shared-datasets-report-builder-and-ssrs.md)  
 Explains the differences in creating, storing, and managing embedded and shared datasets.  
  
 [Data Regions and Maps &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/data-regions-and-maps-report-builder-and-ssrs.md)  
 Describes the types of data regions that can be added to a report layout. Data regions determine the appearance of a report: tabular, matrix, list, or chart.  
  
 [Report Parameters Concept (Report Builder and SSRS)](report-parameters-concepts-report-builder-and-ssrs.md)  
 Describes the ways to define and use report parameters, and how they are independently managed from the report definition on the report server.
