# Q&A in Power BI
## What is Q&A?
Sometimes the fastest way to get an answer from your data, is to ask a question using natural language.  For example, "what were total sales last year."  Use Q&A to explore your data using intuitive, natural language capabilities and receive answers in the form of charts and graphs. Q&A is different from a search engine -- Q&A only provides results about the data in Power BI.

> [!NOTE]
> Q&A is also available in the [Microsoft Power BI app for iOS on iPads, iPhones, and iPod Touch devices](powerbi-mobile-ios-qna.md).
