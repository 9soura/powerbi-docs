# Navigate the 'new look' of the Power BI service

The Power BI service has a new look. We’ve refreshed the user interface for viewing reports. The new look provides a modern experience that’s simpler and builds on customers’ familiarity with Microsoft products. Across the user interface, we’ve switched to a lighter color theme and updated icons. They complement the canvas, making report content the main point of focus. Here's an overview of what’s changed in the new look:

## 1. Opt in to the new look
All Power BI service users can opt in to the new look by selecting **New look on**.

## 2. View metadata 

We’ve surfaced details such as last refresh date and contact information to give you additional context on the report. You can view additional details by opening the menu.

## 3. Vertical navigation 
We've switched the horizontal page tabs to a vertical list of pages. Report pages are now prominent, hard to miss, and similar to navigation in Word and PowerPoint. You can increase or decrease the screen area by resizing the pane.

## 4. Simplified action bar 

A new, updated action bar designed to surface the most relevant commands front and center for report consumers. Now it's easier to export, subscribe, collaborate with others, and delve deeper through filters and bookmarks.

## 5. No features removed

The new look has 100% parity with the old look. We didn't remove any functionality. You can find the additional commands such as edit, save a copy, and so on, by expanding the ellipsis (the ... menu) in the action bar. Access the usage metrics from the content list.

## 6. New filter experience

Recent updates such as viewing applied filters and the new filters pane are available by default with the new look. Even if the report designers haven't upgraded to the new filters experience, you see the new filters pane.

## 7. Dashboard 'new look' experience 

The action bar is simplified across dashboards, reports, and apps to provide a consistent experience, while retaining the functional differences. Here's a walkthrough of actions in a dashboard.

## No changes to edit mode 

We’ve kept the authoring experience similar to that in Desktop. The new look changes only apply to the reading view.
