# Install, customize, and distribute template apps in your organization 

Power BI template apps are a new capability that enables Power BI partners to build Power BI apps with little or no coding, and deploy them to any Power BI customer. This article explains how you install, customize and distribute a template app created by a Power BI partner. If you're interested in creating template apps to distribute yourself, see [Create a template app in Power BI](service-template-apps-create.md).

When you install a template app that a Power BI partner has created, you can modify it to meet the needs of your organization, and then distribute it to your colleagues as an app.  

## Prerequisites  

The requirements for installing, customizing, and distributing a template app are few:  

- A [Power BI pro license](service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md)
- Familiarity with the [basic concepts of Power BI ](service-basic-concepts.md)
- Valid installation link from the template app creator or AppSource.  

## Resources 

 For this article, we created a sample app with

## Install a template app

You may receive a link to a template app, or you may find one that interests you in AppSource. Either way, your first step is to install it. After that, you can modify it and distribute it to your own organization.

1. For this sample template app, select the installation link, or copy and paste it into your browser window to start the installation.  

2. In the dialog box, select **Install**.

    If you have a Power BI Pro license, the app is installed with its associated app workspace. You customize the app in the associated workspace.

    When installation succeeds, you see a notification that your new app is ready. 

3. Click **Go to app**.
4. In **Get started with your new app**, select one of three options:

    - **Explore app**: Basic sample data exploration. Start here to get the look and feel of the app. 
    - **Connect data**: Explore your own data. You can redefine dataset parameters and data source credentials.
    - **Go to workspace** (most advanced option): you can make any changes allowed by the app builder.

    Or skip this dialog box and access the app or associated workspace directly via **Apps** or **Workspaces** in the left navigation pane.   
 
5. In this case, select **Explore App** to explore the sample.   

1. In the left navigation pane, select **Workspaces** and go to associated workspace. The workspace has the same name as the template app. 

6. Try customizing the dashboard: Move and resize the tiles. Do you want to apply any customization steps for it?  To customize the dashboard?  To replace the dataset? To change the color of app logo?

## Update and distribute the app

1. When you've finished customizing the dashboard and report, select **Update app** in the upper-right corner.  
2. In **Details**, you can modify the description and background color.
3. In **Content**, you can select a landing page, either the dashboard or the report.
4. In **Access** you give access either to selected users or to your whole organization.  
5. Select **Update app**. 
6. After it's successfully published, you can copy the link and share it with whomever you've given access to. If you've shared it with them, they also see it on the **My organization** tab in AppSource.
