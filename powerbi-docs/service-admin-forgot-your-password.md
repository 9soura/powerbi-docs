# Forgot your password for Power BI?
If you've forgotten your password, you can use the following link to request a password reset.

<https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com>

If you're told that your account is not enabled for password reset, you'll need to contact your Office 365 administrator. If you're using the free trial, the administrator is the first person in your organization who signed up.

If you are still having issues accessing your account you can try contacting the support team for password resets. This is not the support number for the Power BI service!

*1-800-642-7676*
