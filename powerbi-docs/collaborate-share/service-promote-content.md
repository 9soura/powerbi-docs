# Promote your content (preview)

Power BI provides two ways you can increase the visibility of your valuable, high-quality dataflows: **promotion** and **certification**.

As a content owner you can promote your own content when it's ready for wide-spread usage. Any workspace member with write permissions on the workspace where the content is located can promote the content. There are no restrictions on who can promote a dataset. Promotion supports the collaborative spread of datasets within organizations. This article is about promoting your dataset.

* **Promotion**: Promotion enables users to highlight content they think is valuable and worthwhile for others to use. In this way it encourages the collaborative use and spread of content within an organization. Any content owner, as well as any member with write permissions on the workspace where the content is located, can simply promote the content when they think it's good enough for sharing.

* **Certification**: Certification means that the content meets the organization's quality standards and can be regarded as reliable, authoritive, and ready for use across the organization. Only a select group of reviewers can certify content. Content owners who wish to see their content certified and are not authorized to certify it themselves need to follow their organization's guidelines about getting their content certified.

  Dataflow certification is possible only if it has been [enabled by the Power BI administrator](../admin/service-admin-setup-certification.md).

Promoting or certifying a dataflow is called *endorsement*. Power BI report creators often have many different dataflows to choose from, and endorsement helps guide them to the dataflows that are reliable, trust-worthy, and authoritative.

Endorsed dataflows are clearly labeled in many places in Power BI, making it easy for report creators to find them when they are looking for reliable data, and for administrators and report creators to track how they are being used throughout the organization.

The image below shows how promoted and certified dataflows are easily identified in Power Query.

This article describes how to promoting content, and how to request content certification.

## Promote a dataflow

To promote a dataflow, you must have write permissions the workspace where the dataflow you want to promote is located.

1. Go to the list of dataflows in the workspace.
 
1. Select **More options** (...) on the dataflow you want to promote, then select **Settings**.

1. Select **Apply**.

## Certify a dataflow

This section is intended for users who have been authorized by their Power BI admin to certify dataflows. Certifying dataflows is a big responsibility. This section explains the certification process you go through.

1. Get write permissions on the workspace where the dataflow you want to certify resides. This could be from dataflow owner or from anyone with admin permissions on the workspace. 

1. Carefully review the dataflow and determine whether it merits certification.

1. If you decide to certify the dataflow, go to the workspace where it resides.
 
1. Find the dataflow you are looking for, click **More options** (...), then select **Settings**.
