# Promote your content (preview)

Power BI provides two ways you can increase the visibility of your valuable, high-quality content: **promotion** and **certification**.



* **Promotion**: Promotion enables you to highlight content you think is valuable and worthwhile for others to use. In this way it encourages the collaborative use and spread of content within an organization. Any content owner, as well as any member with write permissions on the workspace where the content is located, can simply promote the content when they think it's good enough for sharing.

* **Certification**: Certification means that the content meets the organization's quality standards and can be regarded as reliable, authoritative, and ready for use across the organization. Only authorized reviewers can certify content. Content owners who wish to see their content certified and are not authorized to certify it themselves must follow their organization's guidelines about getting their content certified.

This article describes how to promoting content, and how to request content certification.

1. Get write permissions on the workspace where the dataflow you want to certify resides. This could be from dataflow owner or from anyone with admin permissions on the workspace. 

1. Carefully review the dataflow and determine whether it merits certification.

1. If you decide to certify the dataflow, go to the workspace where it resides.
