# Add the Power BI app to Microsoft Teams

As a distributed and remote workforce becomes the norm, more organizations are relying on Microsoft Teams to keep employees in sync. This article describes installing and interacting with the Power BI app in Teams. The Power BI app brings your entire basic Power BI service experience into Teams.

## Requirements

In general, for Power BI to work in Microsoft Teams, ensure these elements:

- You have a Power BI Pro license.
- You have signed in to the Power BI service to activate your Power BI license.

## What is the Power BI app

With the Power BI app in Microsoft Teams, you interact with all of your Power BI content, right in Teams. It's as if the Power BI service lived inside Teams. This app is your personal experience of Power BI. After you install it, you can do almost everything in Teams that you can do in the Power BI service:

- Create, view, and edit dashboards, reports, and apps.
- Create and participate in workspaces.
- Share content, either through email or through Teams.

There are a few features that you can only access in the Power BI service in a browser. See the [Known issues and limitations](#known-issues-and-limitations) section of this article for details.
 
## Install the Power BI app

Select **More added apps** in the left navigation bar > Power BI.

That's it! The Power BI app is installed in Microsoft Teams.

## Interact with your content in Teams

Most interactions with your content are the same, whether they're your dashboards, reports, apps, or workspaces. A few interactions are different.

When you're looking at a dashboard or report, you don't see the Power BI navigation pane. Select the **Close** button to go back to Home or the workspace.

You can also choose to open the report in the Power BI service instead of viewing it in Teams. Select **Open this on the web**.

## Known issues and limitations

- Power BI doesn't support the same localized languages that Microsoft Teams does. As a result, you might not see proper localization within a report.
- Some options available in the Power BI service aren't available in Teams. These include:
    - Settings such as managing personal storage and accessing the admin portal.
    - Notifications.
    - Downloading apps such as Power BI Desktop and Power BI Paginated Report Builder.
    - Sending feedback.
