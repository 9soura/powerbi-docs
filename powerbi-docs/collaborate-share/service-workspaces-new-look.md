# Opt in to the workspace 'new look' (preview)

Workspaces have a new look that coincides with the new look of the Power BI service. Anyone using the Power BI service (app.powerbi.com) can opt in to the new look. When you turn on the **New look** in the black header bar, you opt in to the new look for reports and workspaces. All workspaces, both classic and new, can benefit from the new look.

|Number  |What it does  |
|---------|---------|
| :::image type="icon" source="media/service-workspaces-new-look/circle-one.png" alt-text="Circle 1":::     | Get Data: It's easier to add content to your workspace. The **+ New** button provides one-click access to connect to data, open files, and create reports, dashboards, and more.  |
| :::image type="icon" source="media/service-workspaces-new-look/circle-two.png" alt-text="Circle 2":::     | View switcher: To see the connections between dataflows, datasets, reports, and dashboards, and their connections to other data sources, you have an entry point in the top command bar to switch between list view and lineage view. |
| :::image type="icon" source="media/service-workspaces-new-look/circle-three.png" alt-text="Circle 3":::     | Search within workspace: You can search across all the content in a workspace with the new search box.  |
| :::image type="icon" source="media/service-workspaces-new-look/circle-four.png" alt-text="Circle 4":::     | List and tabs: We've restructured the original tabs to make a flat list of content, like SharePoint. You no longer have to land on the **Dashboards** tab when you open a workspace and wonder where your content is. Here's the new tab order: <br>All – Shows all content (dashboards, reports, workbooks, paginated reports, datasets, dataflows) within the workspace. <br>Content – Shows all content created for consumption (dashboards, reports, workbooks, paginated reports) within the workspace. <br>Datasets + dataflows – Shows all the datasets and dataflows within the workspace for easy data management. |
| :::image type="icon" source="media/service-workspaces-new-look/circle-five.png" alt-text="Circle 5":::  | Filters: For workspaces with hundreds of artifacts, you can quickly filter the content using the new filters pane. Once a filter is applied, you see the filter on top of the content list. |

Quick actions: Quick actions for your content are available on hover. The most common actions are accessible in a single click, and everything else is in the "…" **More options** menu.
