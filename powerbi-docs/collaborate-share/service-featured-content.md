# Feature content on colleagues' Power BI Home page

You can feature dashboards, reports, and apps so they appear on the Featured section of your colleagues' Power BI Home page. Featuring content is especially useful for onboarding new employees to Power BI. You can decide which content they see first. You can add descriptions and small thumbnail images to help users recognize your content.

Your Power BI tenant admin needs to enable the ability to feature content on your tenant. The admin also chooses who can feature content. If you're one of the select group in your organization who can feature content, you also need to have a Power BI Pro license, and you need to have the Admin or Member role in the workspace. See [Roles in the new workspaces](../service-new-workspaces.md#roles-in-the-new-workspaces) for details.
