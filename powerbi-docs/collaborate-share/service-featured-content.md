# Feature content on colleagues' Power BI Home page

You can feature dashboards, reports, and apps so they appear on the Featured section of your colleagues' Power BI Home page. Featuring content is especially useful for onboarding new employees to Power BI. You can decide which content they see first. You can add descriptions and small thumbnail images to help users recognize your content. The content has to be in a new workspace.

It's up to your Power BI tenant admin to enable the ability to feature content on your tenant. The admin also chooses who can feature content. If you're one of the select group in your organization with that responsibility, you also need to have a Power BI Pro license, and you need to have the Admin or Member role in the workspace. See [Roles in the new workspaces](../service-new-workspaces.md#roles-in-the-new-workspaces) for details.

If you feature a dashboard or report from a workspace, then the people who have at least a Viewer role in that workspace will see it featured. If you feature a dashboard or report from an app, or the app itself, then the people you distribute the app to will see it featured.

## Feature a dashboard or report

The procedure for featuring a dashboard or report is similar.

1. In either the **Dashboards** or **Reports** list for a workspace, select the **Settings** icon.

2. In the **Settings** pane, check or change the name, add a **Description**, and upload a **Snapshot**, if you want them. They're a good idea because they help your users find your content.

3. Select **Featured**.

4. Select **Save**.

    Now all users who have access to this dashboard or report will see it in the **Featured** section on **Home**.

## Feature an app

- To feature an app, open the workspace for the app, select the **Options** menu (**...**) > **Feature this app on Home**.

Now everyone who has access to this app will also see it in the **Featured** section on **Home**.
