# Get a Power BI link preview in Microsoft Teams

When you paste a link to your reports, dashboards, and apps into the Microsoft Teams message box, the link preview shows information about the link. Link previews are provided for the following items in Power BI:

- Reports
- Dashboards
- Apps

The link preview service requires your users to sign in. To sign out, select the **Power BI** icon at the bottom of the message box. Then select **Sign out**.

See [Collaborate in Microsoft Teams with Power BI](service-embed-report-microsoft-teams.md) for background on how Power BI and Teams work together, including requirements you need to meet.

## Get a link preview

Follow these steps to get a link preview for content in the Power BI service.

1. Copy a link to a report, a dashboard, or an app in the Power BI service. For example, copy the link from the browser address bar.

1. Paste the link in the Microsoft Teams message box. Sign in to the link preview service if prompted. You might need to wait a few seconds for the link preview to load.

1. Send the message.

## Start a conversation

When you add a Power BI report tab to Microsoft Teams, Teams automatically creates a tab conversation for the report.

- Select the **Show tab conversation** icon in the upper-right corner.

    The first comment is a link to the report. Everyone in that Microsoft Teams channel can see and discuss the report in the conversation.
