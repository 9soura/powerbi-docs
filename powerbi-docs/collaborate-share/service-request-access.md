# Request access to dashboards or reports

If someone sends you a link to a dashboard or a report, but it's not shared with you, you can request access. 

## Request access

When you select the link, if you see a "Request access" message, select **OK**.

In the **Request access** dialog box, you can provide a reason, or just select **Send request**.

You see a confirmation that Power BI has sent your request.

## Grant access

If you're a report owner, you may receive an email from **Microsoft Power BI** saying that someone has requested access to your report.

Select **Grant access**.

The report opens with the **Share report** dialog box already open and the requestor's name filled in.
