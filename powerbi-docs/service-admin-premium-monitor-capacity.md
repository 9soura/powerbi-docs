# Monitor Premium capacities with the app

Monitoring your capacities is essential to making informed decisions on how best to utilize your Premium capacity resources. You can monitor capacities in the Admin portal or with the **Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics** app. This article describes using the Premium Capacity Metrics app. The app provides the most in-depth information into how your capacities are performing. For a higher level overview of average use metrics over the last seven days, you can use the Admin portal. To learn more about monitoring in the portal, see [Monitor Premium capacities in the Admin portal](service-admin-premium-monitor-portal.md).

The app is updated regularly with new features and functionality. Make sure you are running the latest version.
**The latest version of the app is 1.10.1.1 (released February 4th, 2019)**.   
If you have a previous version of the app already installed, it’s best to delete it from your apps and then press CTRL+F5 to refresh. 

## Install the app

You can go straight to [Premium Capacity Metrics app](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/getapps/services/capacitymetrics), or install it like you do other apps in Power BI.


1. In Power BI, click **Apps**.   
    ![Go to Apps](media/service-admin-premium-monitor-capacity/apps.png)

2. On the right side, click **Get apps**.
3. In the **Apps** category, search for **Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics app**.
4. Subscribe to install the app.

Be patient. It takes a few minutes to install and refresh metrics. If the app shows blank metrics, press F5 to refresh your browser.


## Get app refresh history

To check the last time your Premium Capacity Metrics app refreshed, click **Settings** > **Datasets** > **Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics** > **Refresh History**. 

![Refresh history in Settings](media/settings-refresh-history.png)

The last refresh is shown, or click **Refresh history** to see scheduled and on demand refreshes.

## Monitor a capacity with the app

Now that you've installed the app, you can see metrics for the capacities in your organization. Let's take a look at some of the key metrics that are available.

### Metrics dashboard

When you open the app, it first shows a dashboard with a summary of all the capacities for which you have admin rights.

![Metrics app dashboard](media/service-admin-premium-monitor-capacity/app-dashboard.png)

The dashboard includes the following metrics:

### Metrics report

Click the dashboard to go to the underlying report. At the bottom of the report, there are five tabs:

* [**Datasets**](#datasets) - Detailed metrics on the health of the Power BI datasets in your capacities.

* [**Paginated Reports**](#paginated-reports) - Detailed metrics on the health of the paginated reports in your capacities.

* [**Dataflows**](#dataflows) - Detailed refresh metrics for dataflows in your capacities.

* [**Resource Consumption**](#resource-consumption) - Overall capacity metrics including memory and CPU high utilization.

* [**IDs and Info**](#ids-and-info) - Names, IDs, and owners for capacities, workspaces, and workloads.

On each tab, you can filter metrics by capacity and date range. If no filters are selected, the report defaults to show the past week’s metrics for all capacities that are reporting metrics. 

#### Datasets

Use the buttons at the top of the **Datasets** tab to navigate to different areas: **Refreshes**, **Query Durations**, **Query Waits**, and **Datasets**.

##### Refreshes area

The **Refreshes** area contains the following metrics.

| **Report section** | **Metrics** |
| --- | --- |
| **Refresh reliability** |  Total Count: Total refreshes for each dataset<br>  Reliability: the percentage of refreshes that completed for each dataset<br>  Avg Wait Time: The average lag between the scheduled time and start of a refresh for the dataset, in minutes<br>  Max Wait Time: The maximum wait time for the dataset, in minutes <br>  Avg Duration: The average duration of refresh for the dataset, in minutes<br>  Max Duration: The duration of the longest-running refresh for the dataset, in minutes |
| **Top 5 Datasets by Average Refresh Duration** |  The five datasets with the longest average refresh duration, in minutes |
| **Top 5 Datasets by Average Wait Time** |  The five datasets with the longest average refresh wait time,  in minutes |
| **Hourly Average Refresh Wait Times** |  The average refresh wait time, split into one hour buckets, reported in local time. Multiple spikes with high refresh wait times are indicative of the capacity running hot. |
| **Hourly Refresh Count and Memory Consumption** |  Successes, failures, and memory consumption, split into one hour buckets, reported in local time |
|  |  |

##### Query Durations area

The **Query Durations** area contains the following metrics.

| **Report section** | **Metrics** |
| --- | --- |

Datasets that are inactive (with no query/refresh operation currently executing) are evicted first. Then the eviction order is based on a measure of 'least recently used' (LRU).|
| **Hourly Dataset Evictions and Memory Consumption** |  Dataset evictions vs. memory consumption in GB, split into one hour buckets, reported in local time |
| **Hourly Loaded Dataset Counts** |  Number of datasets loaded into memory vs. memory consumption in GB, split into one hour buckets, reported in local time |
| **Consumed Memory Percentages** |  Total active datasets in memory as a percentage of total memory. The delta between Active and All define datasets that can be evicted. Shown hourly, for the previous seven days. |

## Monitor Power BI Embedded capacity

You can use the Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics app to monitor *A SKU* capacities in Power BI Embedded. Those capacities will show up in the report as long as you are an admin of the capacity. However, refresh of the report fails unless you grant certain permissions to Power BI on your A SKUs:

1. Open your capacity in the Azure portal.

1. Click **Access control (IAM)**, and add the “Power BI Premium” app to the reader role. If you are unable to find the app by name, you can also add it by its client Id: cb4dc29f-0bf4-402a-8b30-7511498ed654.

    ![Permissions for Power BI Embedded](media/service-admin-premium-monitor-capacity/embedded-permissions.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You can monitor Power BI Embedded capacity usage in the app or the Azure portal, but not in the Power BI admin portal.
