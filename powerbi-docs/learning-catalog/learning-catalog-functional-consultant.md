By using Task Manager and DAX Studio, you will be able to determine whether you should change the report layout, or if there is something in DAX formulas or in the data model that is responsible for the slow response.  At the end of this session, you will understand how to locate a performance bottleneck in a Power BI report, so you will focus your attention on the biggest issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Webinar       | 34min 35sec       |

It is now possible to create measures that dynamically update to account for user selections and filters. This technique is available for use with any visual that renders Image URLs as an image.
