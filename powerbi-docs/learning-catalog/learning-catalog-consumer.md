However, when I walk into a client and open their existing Power BI Models, I cringe! In one word, I find them "ugly". Learn-on-your-own business users, often lack the core principles and guidelines for Power BI Modeling. In this session, I want to share with you the key best practices and guidelines for building Power BI Models, which would make your Power BI models "beautiful", inside and out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Webinar                                                                        | 29min 19sec    | Power BI Modeling Best Practices for Business Users by Avi Singh                                     |
