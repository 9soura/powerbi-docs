# Service principal with Power BI (Preview)

With **service principal**, you can embed Power BI content into an application and use automation with Power BI using an **app-only** token. Service principal is beneficial when using **Power BI Embedded** or when **automating Power BI tasks and processes**.

When working with Power BI Embedded, there are advantages when using service principal.  A primary advantage is you do not need a master user account (Power BI Pro license) to authenticate into your application. Service principal uses an application ID and an application secret to authenticate the application.

As you automate various tasks with Power BI APIs, you can now script creating a service principal (app-only token) to use for authentication. You can script service principal to scale.

## Application and service principal relationship

To access resources that secure an Azure AD tenant, the entity that requires access represents a security principal. This action holds true for both users (user principal) and applications (service principal).

The security principal defines the access policy and permissions for users and applications in the Azure AD tenant. This access policy enables core features such as authentication of users and applications during sign-in, and authorization during resource access. For more information, reference [service principal object](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals#service-principal-object).

When you [register an Azure AD application](register-app.md) in the Azure portal, two objects are created in your Azure AD tenant:

* An application object
* A [service principal object]((https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals#service-principal-object))

Consider the application object as the *global* representation of your application for use across all tenants, and the service principal as the *local* representation for use in a specific tenant.

The application object serves as the template from which common and default properties are *derived* for use in creating corresponding service principal objects.

A service principal is required per tenant where the application is used, enabling it to establish an identity for sign-in and access to resources that are secured by the tenant. A single-tenant application has only one service principal (in its home tenant), created and consented for use during application registration.

## Service principal with Power BI Embedded

With service principal, you can mask your master user account information in your application by using an application ID (app ID) and an application secret (app secret). You don't have to hard-code a master user account into your application to authenticate.

Since **Power BI APIs** and **Power BI .NET SDK** now support calls using service principal, you can use all the [Power BI APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/) with service principal. For example, you can make changes to workspaces such as create workspaces, add or remove users from workspaces, and import content into workspaces.

You can only use a service principal if your Power BI artifacts and resources are stored in a [Power BI new workspace](../service-create-the-new-workspaces.md).

## Service principal vs. master user account

There are differences between using a service principal and a standard master user account (Power BI Pro license) for authentication.

| Function | Master User Account </br> (Power BI Pro license) | Service Principal </br> (app-only token) |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Can sign in to the Power BI service  | Yes | No |
| Needs to be enabled in the Power BI Admin portal | No | Yes |
| Works with app workspaces (v1) | Yes | No |
| Works with the new app workspaces (v2) | Yes | Yes |
| Needs to be a workspace admin | Yes | Yes |
| Can use multi-factor authentication (MFA) in Azure | No | Yes |
| Power BI REST APIs | Yes | Yes |
| Needs a global admin to create | Yes | No |
| Can install and manage an On-premises data gateway | Yes | No |

## Get started with service principal

Different from the traditional use of a master user account, using the service principal (app-only token) requires a few different pieces to set up. Now to get started with the service principal (app-only token) you need to set up the right environment.

1. You need to [register an Azure AD application](register-app.md) to capture an Application ID and an Application secret to access your Power BI content.  When you use the [register app tool](https://dev.powerbi.com/apps), choose **Server-side web application** to go through the process of gathering an Application ID and an Application secret.

2. [Set up your Power BI environment](embed-sample-for-customers.md#set-up-your-power-bi-environment).

3. Now you can choose to embed your content either through the [sample application](https://app.powerbi.com/embedsetup/appownsdata) that you can download or within your own application.

    [Embed your content using the sample application](embed-sample-for-customers.md#embed-your-content-using-the-sample-application)

    [Embed your content within your application](embed-sample-for-customers.md#embed-your-content-within-your-application)

### Provision

Service principals inherit the permissions for all Power 81 tenant settings from their security group. To restrict permissions, create a dedicated security group for service principals and add it to the 'Except specific security groups' list for the relevant, enabled Power BI settings.

## Using Powershell to create service principal

1. Open Powershell as an administrator

2. Install the Azure AD module

    ```powershell
    Install-Module -Name AzureAD
    ```
3. Then run the command *Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass*

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
    ```
4. Run Powershell script

    ```powershell
    param (
    [string]$applicationName
    )

    # Login to Azure and be able to use the app cmdlets
    Connect-AzureAD
    Login-AzureRmAccount

    # Create a new AAD web application
    $App = New-AzureADApplication -DisplayName $applicationName -Homepage "https://localhost:44322" -ReplyUrls "https://localhost:44322"

    # Add service principal to the application (only for allowed users)
    New-AzureRmADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $App.AppId
    ```

    > [!Note]
    > Once you exit out of the blade, it is not visible any more so save it. However, if you forget to save it, then you can just craete a new one.

## Migrate to service principal

You can take steps to migrate to use service principal if you're currently using a master user account with Power BI or with your Power BI Embedded application.

1. You need to [register an Azure AD application](register-app.md) to capture an Application ID and an Application secret to access your Power BI content.  When you use the [register app tool](https://dev.powerbi.com/apps), choose **Server-side web application** to go through the process of gathering an Application ID and an Application secret.

2. Create [new workspaces](../service-create-the-new-workspaces.md) in the Power BI service to copy or move your Power BI artifacts.

3. [Copy or move Power BI artifacts into the new workspaces](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pt-br/blog/duplicate-workspaces-using-the-power-bi-rest-apis-a-step-by-step-tutorial/). Currently there is no UI feature to move Power BI artifacts from one workspace to another. As such, you need to use APIs to accomplish this task.

4. Then with an admin master user account, sign in to Power BI and enable the service principal developer setting in the Power BI admin portal.

5. Create a [security group in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/security-overview), and add the application you created to that security group.

6. Now log into Power BI with a Power BI Pro license to be able to access the workspaces you created, and add the security group you created to the workspace as an admin.

## Considerations and limitations

* Service principal only works with [new app workspaces](../service-create-the-new-workspaces.md).
* **My Workspace** isn't supported when using service principal.
* Dedicated capacity is required when moving to production.
* You can't sign into the Power BI portal using service principal.
* Power BI admin rights are required to enable service principal in developer settings within the Power BI admin portal.
* You can't install or manage an on-premises data gateway using service principal.

## Next steps

* [Register an app](register-app.md)
* [Power BI Embedded for your customers](embed-sample-for-customers.md)
* [Application and service principal objects in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals)
