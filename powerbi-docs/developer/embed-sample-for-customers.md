# Tutorial: Embed a Power BI report, dashboard or tile into an application for your customers
As an ISV developer you can embed reports, dashbards, or tiles into an application so that your customers can share data. To integrate a report, dashboard, or tile into an application, you use the **Power BI** API, an **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)** authorization **access token** and an embed token.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Prerequisites
To get started, you need a **Power BI Pro** account and a **Microsoft Azure** account.

* If you're not signed up for **Power BI Pro**, [sign up for a free trial](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/) before you begin.
* If you don’t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
* You need to have your own [Azure Active Directory tenant ](create-an-azure-active-directory-tenant.md) setup.
* You need Visual Studio installed (version 2013 or later).

## Setup your embedded analytics development environment

Before you start embedding reports, dashboard, or tiles into your application, you need to make sure your environment is setup to allow for embedding. As part of the setup, you will need to do the following.

### Register an application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

You register your application with Azure Active Directory to allow your application access to the Power BI REST APIs. This allows you to establish an identity for your application and specify permissions to Power BI REST resources.

1. Accept the [Microsoft Power BI API Terms](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/api-terms).

2. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
 
    ![Azure Portal Main](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-002.png)

3. In the left-hand navigation pane, choose **More Services**, select **App Registrations** under **Security + Identity** and select **New application registration**.

    ![New App registration](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-004.png)

4. Follow the prompts and create a new application. For apps owns data you need to use **Native** for the application type. You also need to provide a **Redirect URI**, which **Azure AD** uses to return token responses. Enter a value specific to your application (for example: http://localhost:13526/redirect).

    ![Create App](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-005.png)

### Get the client id
When you register an application, you receive a **Client ID**. The **Client ID** is used by the application to identify themselves to the users from which you're requesting permissions.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

    ![Azure Portal Main](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-002.png)

2. In the left-hand navigation pane, choose **More Services** and select **App Registrations**.

    ![App registration search](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-003.png)

3. Select the application that you want to retrieve the client id for.

    ![Choosing App](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-006.png)

4. You will see **Application ID** listed as a GUID. This is the client id for the application.
   
    ![Client ID](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-007.png)

### Apply permissions to your application within Azure Active Directory

You will need to enable additional permissions to your application in addition to what was provided in app registration page. You can accomplish this through the Azure Active Directory portal, or programmatically.

You need to be logged in with the *master* account, used for embedding, which needs to be a global admin account.

### Use the Azure Active Directory portal

1. Browse to [App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ApplicationsListBlade) within the Azure portal and select the app that you are using for embedding.
   
    ![Choosing App](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-006.png)

2. Select **Settings**, then under **API Access** select **Required permissions**.
   
    ![Required Permissions](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-008.png)

3. Select **Windows Azure Active Directory** and then make sure **Access the directory as the signed-in user** is selected. Select **Save**.
   
    ![Windows Azure AD Permissions](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-011.png)

4. Select **Add**.

    ![Add Permissions](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-012.png)

5. Select **Select an API**.

    ![Add API Access](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-013.png)

6. Select **Power BI Service**, then select **Select**.

    ![Select PBI Services](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-014.png)

7. Select all permissions under **Delegated Permissions**. You will need to select them one by one in order to save the selections. Select **Save** when done.
   
    ![Select delegated permissions](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-015.png)

8. Within **Required permissions**, select **Grant Permissions**.
   
    The **Grant Permissions** action is needed for the *master account* to avoid being prompted for consent by Azure AD. If the account performing this action is a Global Admin, you will grant permissions to all users within your organization for this application. If the account performing this action is the *master account* and is not a Global Admin, you will grant permissions only to the *master account* for this application.

### Create your Power BI Embedded dedicated capacity in Azure

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

    ![Azure Portal Main](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-002.png)

2. In the left-hand navigation pane, choose **More Services** and select **Power BI Embedded**.

    ![App registration search](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-017.png)

3. Follow the prompts and fill in the proper information needed to create a new Power BI Embedded Dedicated Capacity, and then select **Create**. When choosing the **Pricing Tier**, review the table below to decide which tier bests suits your needs. Then select **Create** and wait for the resource to complete.

    ![App registration search](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-018.png)

| Capacity Node | Total cores<br/>*(Backend + frontend)* | Backend Cores | Frontend Cores | DirectQuery/live connection limits | Max page renders at peak hour |

## Setup your Power BI environment

### Create an app workspace

If you are embedding reports, dashboards, or tiles for your customers, then you have to be place your content within an app workspace. The *master* account must be an admin of the app workspace.

1. Start by creating the workspace. Select **workspaces** > **Create app workspace**. Create app workspace. This will be the place to put content that your application needs to access.

    ![Create Workspace](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-020.png)

2. Give the workspace a name. If the corresponding **Workspace ID** isn't available, edit it to come up with a unique ID. This will be the name of the app, too.

    ![Name Workspace](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-021.png)

3. You have a few options to set. If you choose **Public**, anyone in your organization can see what’s in the workspace. **Private**, on the other hand, means only members of the workspace can see its contents.

    ![Private/Public](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-022.png)

    You can't change the Public/Private setting after you've created the group.

4. You can also choose if members can **edit** or have **view-only** access.

    ![Adding Members](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-023.png)

5. Add email addresses of people you want to have access to the workspace, and select **Add**. You can’t add group aliases, just individuals.

6. Decide whether each person is a member or an admin. Admins can edit the workspace itself, including adding other members. Members can edit the content in the workspace, unless they have view-only access. Both admins and members can publish the app.

7. Expand **Advanced**, then enable **Dedicated capacity**, then select the **Power BI Embedded dedicated capacity** you created. THen select **Save**.

    ![Adding Members](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-024.png)

Now you can view the new workspace. Power BI creates the workspace and opens it. It appears in the list of workspaces you’re a member of. Because you’re an admin, you can select the ellipsis (…) to go back and make changes to it, adding new members or changing their permissions.

   ![New workspace](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-025.png)

### Create and publish your reports

You can create your reports and datasets using Power BI Desktop and then publish those reports to an app workspace. The end user publishing the reports need to have a Power BI Pro license in order to publish to an app workspace.

1. Download the sample [Blog Demo](https://github.com/Microsoft/powerbi-desktop-samples) from GitHub.

    ![report sample](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-026-1.png)

2. Open sample PBIX report in **Power BI Desktop**

   ![PBI desktop report](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-027.png)

3. Publish to the **app workspace**

   ![PBI desktop report](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-028.png)

    Now you can view the report in the Power BI service online

   ![PBI desktop report](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-029.png)

## Embed your content

1. Download the [App Owns Data sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-Developer-Samples) from GitHub to get started.

    ![App Owns Data application sample](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-026.png)

2. Open up the Web.config file in the sample application. There are 5 fields you will need to fill in to run the application successfully. The **clientID**, the **groupId**, the **reportId**, the **pbiUsername** and the **pbiPassword**.
