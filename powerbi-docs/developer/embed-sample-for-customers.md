# Tutorial: Embed Power BI content into an application for your customers

With **Power BI Embedded in Azure**, you can embed reports, dashboards, or tiles into an application using app owns data. **App owns data** is about having an application that uses Power BI as its embedded analytics platform. As an **ISV developer**, you can create Power BI content that displays reports, dashboards, or tiles in an application that is fully integrated and interactive, without requiring users to have a Power BI license. This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate a report into an application using the Power BI .NET SDK with the Power BI JavaScript API using **Power BI Embedded in Azure** for your customers.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Register an application in Azure.
> * Embed a Power BI report into an application.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need either a **Power BI Pro** account (master user account), or a service principal application (app-only token), and a **Microsoft Azure** subscription.

* If you're not signed up for **Power BI Pro**, [sign up for a free trial](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/) before you begin.
* If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
* You need to have your own [Azure Active Directory tenant](create-an-azure-active-directory-tenant.md) setup.
* You need [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) installed (version 2013 or later).

## Set up your embedded analytics development environment

Before you start embedding reports, dashboard, or tiles into your application, you need to make sure your environment allows for embedding with Power BI.

You can go through the [Embedding setup tool](https://aka.ms/embedsetup/AppOwnsData), so you can quickly get started and download a sample application that helps you walk through creating an environment and embedding a report.

However, if you choose to set up the environment manually, you can continue below.

### Register an application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

[Register your application](register-app.md) with Azure Active Directory to allow your application access to the [Power BI REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/). Registering your application allows you to establish an identity for your application and specify permissions to Power BI REST resources. You can use a master user accont or a [service principal application](embed-service-principal.md) to get started registering an application.

Depending on which method you take, affects which type of application you register in Azure.

If you proceed using a master user account then proceed with registering a **Native** app. You use a Native app because you are working with a non-interactive login.

However, if you proceed using a service principal application, you need to proceed with registering a **server-side web application** app. You register a server-side web application to create an application secret.

1. Accept the [Microsoft Power BI API Terms](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/api-terms).

2. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

    ![Azure portal Main](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-002.png)

3. In the left-hand navigation pane, select **All Services**, select **App Registrations**, and then select **New application registration**.

    ![App registration search](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-003.png)</br>
    ![New App registration](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-004.png)

4. Follow the prompts and create a new application. For use with a **master user account** you need to use **Native** for the application type. For use with a **service principal application** you need to use **Web app/API** for the application type. You also need to provide a **Redirect URL**, which **Azure AD** uses to return token responses. Enter a value specific to your application (for example: `http://localhost:13526/Redirect`).

    | Master user account </br> (Power BI Pro license) | Service principal application </br> (app-only token) |
    |--------------------- | -------------------------------|
    | ![Create App with master account](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-005.png) |  ![Create App with service principal](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-005-sp.png)  |

### Apply permissions to your application within Azure Active Directory

Enable additional permissions for your application, including what was provided on the app registration page. Sign in with the *master* account that you're using for embedding.

### Use the Azure Active Directory portal

1. Browse to [App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ApplicationsListBlade) within the Azure portal and select the app that you're using for embedding.

    ![Choosing App](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-006.png)

2. Select **Settings**, then under **API Access** select **Required permissions**.

    ![Required Permissions](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-008.png)

3. Select **Windows Azure Active Directory** and then make sure **Access the directory as the signed-in user** is selected. Select **Save**.

    ![Windows Azure AD Permissions](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-011.png)

4. Select **Add**.

    ![Add Permissions](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-012.png)

5. Select **Select an API**.

    ![Add API Access](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-013.png)

6. Select **Power BI Service**, then select **Select**.

    ![Select PBI Services](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-014.png)

7. Select all permissions under **Delegated Permissions**. Select **Save** when done.

    ![Select delegated permissions](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-015.png)

8. Within **Required permissions**, select **Grant Permissions**.

    The **Grant Permissions** action needs the *master account* to avoid being prompted for consent by Azure AD. If the account that performs this action is a Global Admin, you need to grant permissions for all users in your organization for this application. If the account that performs this action is the *master account* and isn't a Global Admin, you need to grant permissions only to the *master account* for this application.

    ![Grant permissions within required permissions dialog](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-016.png)

## Set up your Power BI environment

### Create an app workspace

If you're embedding reports, dashboards, or tiles for your customers, then you have to place your content within an app workspace. There are different types of workspaces that you can set up: the [traditional workspaces](../service-create-workspaces.md) or the [new workspaces](../service-create-the-new-workspaces.md). If you are using a *master* account, then it doesn't matter which type of workspaces you use. However, if you use *[service principal](embed-service-principal.md)* to sign into your application, then you're required to you use the new workspaces. In either scneario, both the *master* account and the service principal application you use must be an admin of the app workspaces involved with your application.

### Create and publish your reports

You can create your reports and datasets using Power BI Desktop and then publish those reports to an app workspace. There are two ways to accomplish this: As an end user, you can publish reports to a traditional app workspace with a master user account (Power BI Pro license). If you are using a service principal application, you can publish reports to the new workspaces using the [Power BI REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/reports).

The below steps walk through how to publish your PBIX report to your Power BI workspace.

1. Download the sample [Blog Demo](https://github.com/Microsoft/powerbi-desktop-samples) from GitHub.

    ![report sample](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-026-1.png)

2. Open sample PBIX report in **Power BI Desktop**.

   ![PBI desktop report](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-027.png)

3. Publish to **app workspaces**.  This process differs depending on whether you are using a master user account (Power Pro license), or a service principal application. If you are using a master user account, then you can publish your report through Power BI Desktop.  Now if you are using a service principal application, you must use the Power BI REST APIs.

## Embed your content using the sample application

Follow these steps to start embedding your content using a sample application.

1. Download the [App Owns Data sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-Developer-Samples) from GitHub to get started.

    ![App Owns Data application sample](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-026.png)

2. Open up the **Web.config** file in the sample application. There are fields you need to fill in to run the application.

    * **[applicationId](#application-id)** (required for both master user account and [service principal](embed-service-principal.md)).
    * **[application secret](#application-secret)** (required for [service principal](embed-service-principal.md)).
    * **[workspaceId](#workspace-id)** (required for both master user account and [service principal](embed-service-principal.md)).
    * **[reportId](#report-id)** (required for both master user account and [service principal](embed-service-principal.md)).
    * **[pbiUsername](#power-bi-username-and-password)** (required for use with a master account).
    * **[pbiPassword](#power-bi-username-and-password)** (required for use with a master account).

    ![Web Config file](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-030.png)

### Application ID

Fill in the **applicationId** information with the **Application ID** from **Azure**. The **applicationId** is used by the application to identify itself to the users from which you're requesting permissions. To get the **applicationId**, follow these steps:

Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

![Azure portal Main](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-002.png)

In the left-hand navigation pane, select **All Services**, and select **App Registrations**.

![App registration search](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-003.png)

Select the application that you want to get the **applicationId** for.

![Choosing App](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-006.png)

You should see an **Application ID** that is listed as a GUID. Use this **Application ID** as the **applicationId** for the application.

![applicationId](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-007.png)

### Application secret

Fill in the **ApplicationSecret** information from the **Keys** section of your **App registrations** section in **Azure**.  This attribute works specifically when using a [service principal application](embed-service-principal.md).

To get the **ApplicationSecret**, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

    ![Azure portal](media/embed-sample-for-your-organization/embed-sample-for-your-organization-002.png)

2. In the left-hand navigation pane, choose **All services** and select **App registrations**.

    ![App registration search](media/embed-sample-for-your-organization/embed-sample-for-your-organization-003.png)

3. Select the application that needs to use the **ApplicationSecret**.

    ![Choose an app](media/embed-sample-for-your-organization/embed-sample-for-your-organization-006.png)

4. Select **Settings**.

    ![Select Settings](media/embed-sample-for-your-organization/embed-sample-for-your-organization-038.png)

5. Select **Keys**.

    ![Select Keys](media/embed-sample-for-your-organization/embed-sample-for-your-organization-039.png)

6. Enter a name in the **Description** box and select a duration. Then select **Save** to get the **Value** for your application. When you close the **Keys** pane after saving the key value, the value field shows only as hidden. At that point, you aren't able to retrieve the key value. If you lose the key value, create a new one in the Azure portal.

    ![Key value](media/embed-sample-for-your-organization/embed-sample-for-your-organization-031.png)

### Workspace ID

Fill in the **workspaceId** information with the **app workspace GUID** from Power BI. You can get this information either from the URL when signed into the Power BI service or using Powershell.

| URL | Powershell |
|--------------------- | -------------------------------|
|![workspaceId](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-031.png) | ![workspaceId from powershell](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-031-ps.png) |

### Report ID

Fill in the **reportId** information with the **report GUID** from Power BI.

| URL | Powershell |
|--------------------- | -------------------------------|
|![reportId](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-032.png) | ![reportId from powershell](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-032-ps.png) |

### Power BI username and password

If you are using a [service principal application](embed-service-principal.md) to authenticate, then you don't need to fill in the username or password attributes.

* Fill in the **pbiUsername** with the Power BI master user account.
* Fill in the **pbiPassword** with the password for the Power BI master user account.

3. Run the application!

    First select **Run** in **Visual Studio**.

    ![Run the application](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-033.png)

    Then select **Embed Report**. Depending on which content you choose to test with - reports, dashboards or tiles - then select that option in the application.

    ![Select a content](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-034.png)

    Now you can view the report in the sample application.

    ![View application](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-035.png)

## Embed your content within your application

Even though the steps to embed your content can be done with the [Power BI REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/), the example codes described in this article are made with the **.NET SDK**.

Embedding for your customers within your application requires you to get an **access token** for your master account from **Azure AD**. It's required to get an [Azure AD access token](get-azuread-access-token.md#access-token-for-non-power-bi-users-app-owns-data) for your Power BI application using **app owns data** before you make calls to the [Power BI REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/).

To create the Power BI Client with your **access token**, you want to create your Power BI client object, which allows you to interact with the [Power BI REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/). You create the Power BI client object by wrapping the **AccessToken** with a ***Microsoft.Rest.TokenCredentials*** object.

```csharp
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory;
using Microsoft.Rest;
using Microsoft.PowerBI.Api.V2;

var tokenCredentials = new TokenCredentials(authenticationResult.AccessToken, "Bearer");

// Create a Power BI Client object. it's used to call Power BI APIs.
using (var client = new PowerBIClient(new Uri(ApiUrl), tokenCredentials))
{
    // Your code to embed items.
}
```

### Get the content item you want to embed

You can use the Power BI client object to retrieve a reference to the item you want to embed.

Here is a code sample of how to retrieve the first report from a given workspace.

*A sample of getting a content item whether it's a report, dashboard, or tile that you want to embed is available within the Controllers\HomeController.cs file in the [sample application](#embed-your-content-within-a-sample-application).*

```csharp
using Microsoft.PowerBI.Api.V2;
using Microsoft.PowerBI.Api.V2.Models;

// You need to provide the workspaceId where the dashboard resides.
ODataResponseListReport reports = await client.Reports.GetReportsInGroupAsync(workspaceId);

// Get the first report in the group.
Report report = reports.Value.FirstOrDefault();
```

### Create the embed token

Generated an embed token, which can be used from the JavaScript API. The embed token is specific to the item you're embedding. So at any time you embed a piece of Power BI content, you need to create a new embed token for it. For more information, including which **accessLevel** to use, see [GenerateToken API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt784614.aspx).

Here is a sample of adding an embed token for a report to your application.

*A sample of creating an embed token for a report, dashboard, or tile is available within the Controllers\HomeController.cs file in the [sample application](#embed-your-content-within-a-sample-application).*

```csharp
using Microsoft.PowerBI.Api.V2;
using Microsoft.PowerBI.Api.V2.Models;

// Generate Embed Token.
var generateTokenRequestParameters = new GenerateTokenRequest(accessLevel: "view");
EmbedToken tokenResponse = client.Reports.GenerateTokenInGroup(workspaceId, report.Id, generateTokenRequestParameters);

// Generate Embed Configuration.
var embedConfig = new EmbedConfig()
{
    EmbedToken = tokenResponse,
    EmbedUrl = report.EmbedUrl,
    Id = report.Id
};
```

A class is created for **EmbedConfig** and **TileEmbedConfig**. A sample is available within the **Models\EmbedConfig.cs** file and the **Models\TileEmbedConfig.cs file**.

### Load an item using JavaScript

You can use JavaScript to load a report into a div element on your web page.

For a full sample of using the JavaScript API, you can use the [Playground tool](https://microsoft.github.io/PowerBI-JavaScript/demo). The Playground tool is a quick way to play with different types of Power BI Embedded samples. You can also get more Information about the JavaScript API by visiting the [PowerBI-JavaScript wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/powerbi-javascript/wiki) page.

Here is a sample that uses an **EmbedConfig** model and a **TileEmbedConfig** model along with views for a report.

*A sample of adding a view for a report, dashboard, or tile is available within the Views\Home\EmbedReport.cshtml, Views\Home\EmbedDashboard.cshtml, or the Views\Home\Embedtile.cshtml files in the [sample application](#embed-your-content-within-a-sample-application).*

```javascript
<script src="~/scripts/powerbi.js"></script>
<div id="reportContainer"></div>
<script>
    // Read embed application token from Model
    var accessToken = "@Model.EmbedToken.Token";

    // Read embed URL from Model
    var embedUrl = "@Html.Raw(Model.EmbedUrl)";

    // Read report Id from Model
    var embedReportId = "@Model.Id";

    // Get models. models contains enums that can be used.
    var models = window['powerbi-client'].models;

    // Embed configuration used to describe the what and how to embed.
    // This object is used when calling powerbi.embed.
    // This also includes settings and options such as filters.
    // You can find more information at https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-JavaScript/wiki/Embed-Configuration-Details.
    var config = {
        type: 'report',
        tokenType: models.TokenType.Embed,
        accessToken: accessToken,
        embedUrl: embedUrl,
        id: embedReportId,
        permissions: models.Permissions.All,
        settings: {
            filterPaneEnabled: true,
            navContentPaneEnabled: true
        }
    };

    // Get a reference to the embedded report HTML element
    var reportContainer = $('#reportContainer')[0];

    // Embed the report and display it within the div container.
    var report = powerbi.embed(reportContainer, config);
</script>
```

## Move to production

Now that you've completed developing your application, it's time to back your app workspace with a dedicated capacity. Dedicated capacity is required to move to production.

### Create a dedicated capacity

By creating a dedicated capacity, you can take advantage of having a dedicated resource for your customer. You can purchase a dedicated capacity within the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). For details on how to create a Power BI Embedded capacity, see [Create Power BI Embedded capacity in the Azure portal](azure-pbie-create-capacity.md).

Use the table below to determine which Power BI Embedded capacity best fits your needs.

| Capacity Node | Total cores<br/>*(Backend + frontend)* | Backend Cores | Frontend Cores | DirectQuery/live connection limits|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 |1 v-core(s) |0.5 core(s), 3-GB RAM |0.5 cores |0 5 per second |
| A2 |2 v-core(s) |1 core(s), 5-GB RAM |1 cor(e) | 10 per second |
| A3 |4 v-core(s) |2 core(s), 10-GB RAM |2 core(s) | 15 per second |
| A4 |8 v-core(s) |4 core(s), 25-GB RAM |4 core(s) |30 per second |
| A5 |16 v-core(s) |8 core(s), 50-GB RAM |8 core(s) |60 per second |
| A6 |32 v-core(s) |16 core(s), 100-GB RAM |16 core(s) |120 per second |

**_With A SKUs, you can't access Power BI content with a FREE Power BI license._**

Using embed tokens with PRO licenses are intended for development testing, so the number of embed tokens a Power BI master account can generate is limited. A dedicated capacity is required for embedding in a production environment. There's no limit on how many embed tokens you can generate with a dedicated capacity. Go to [Available Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/availablefeatures/getavailablefeatures) to check the usage value that indicates the current embedded usage in percentage. The usage amount is based per master account.

For more information, see [Embedded analytics capacity planning whitepaper](https://aka.ms/pbiewhitepaper).

### Assign an app workspace to a dedicated capacity

Once you create a dedicated capacity, you can assign your app workspace to that dedicated capacity. To assign a dedicated capacity to a workspace, follow these steps.

1. Within the **Power BI service**, expand workspaces and select the ellipsis for the workspace you're using for embedding your content. Then select **Edit workspaces**.

    ![Edit Workspace](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-036.png)

2. Expand **Advanced**, then enable **Dedicated capacity**, then select the dedicated capacity you created. Then select **Save**.

    ![Assign dedicated capacity](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-024.png)

3. After you select **Save**, you should see a **diamond** next to the app workspace name.
