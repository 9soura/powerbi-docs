# Dynamic binding

Dynamic binding allows embedding a report across multiple datasets with the same data schema. End users see different results, depending on the dataset the report is connected to.

An embedded report built on a shared dataset will render only if both workspaces (the one containing the content and the one containing the dataset) are assigned to a capacity.

Embedding a report using dynamic binding has two stages:
1. Generating a token
2. Adjusting the config object

## Generating a token
To generate a token, create an [Embed token v2](embed-sample-for-customers.md#embedToken2).

The following table lists the considerations you need to take into account when generating the token.


| Solution                   | Token                               | Requirements                                                                                                                                                  |

| *Embedding for your organization* | Access token for Power BI users     | The user whoâ€™s Azure AD token is used, must have appropriate permissions for all artifacts.                                                                    |
| *Embedding for your customers*    | Access token for non-Power BI users | Must include permissions for both the report and the dynamically bound dataset. Use the new API to generate an embed token which supports multiple artifacts. |
## Adjusting the config object
Add `datasetBinding` to the config object. Use the example at the bottom of the page as a reference.

If you're new to embedding in Power BI, review these tutorials to learn how to embed your Power BI content:
* [Embed Power BI content into an application for your customers](embed-sample-for-customers.md)
* [Tutorial: Embed Power BI content into an application for your organization](embed-sample-for-your-organization.md)

 ### Example
```javascript
var config = {
    type: 'report',
    tokenType: models.TokenType.Embed,
    accessToken: accessToken,
    embedUrl: embedUrl,
    id: "reportId", // The wanted report id
    permissions: permissions,
    datasetBinding: {
		datasetId: "notOriginalDatasetId", // The wanted dataset id
	}
};

// Get a reference to the embedded report HTML element
var embedContainer = $('#embedContainer')[0];

// Embed the report and display it within the div container
var report = powerbi.embed(embedContainer, config);
```
