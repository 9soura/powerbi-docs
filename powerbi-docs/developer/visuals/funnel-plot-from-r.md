# Funnel Plot from R script to R Visual
This article describes how to build a funnel plot using R script in R visual step by step.

A funnel plot is easy to consume and interpret where the "funnel" is formed by confidence limits and shows the amount of expected variations with outliers represented by dots outside the funnel.

The example in this article is based on an [inspiring story](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/28/bad-science-diy-data-analysis) about how using the wrong visualization tools can lead to the wrong conclusion. The hero of this story is the funnel plot, which is used to compare and analyze institutional performance and medical data.

For more information, see [this blog ](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/10/31/power-tools-for-aspiring-data-journalists-funnel-plots-in-r/) to further demonstrate an implementation of a "funnel plot" in R.

## Example

In this article we'll create:

- an R-script for RStudio
- an R-visual in Power BI
- a *PNG-based* R-powered Visual in Power BI
- a *HTML-based* R-powered Visual in Power BI

1. Build an R script with dataset:

   1. Start with a [minimal R script](./samples/funnel-plot/chapter1_R/script_R_v1_00.r) and the accompanying data table [dataset.csv](./samples/funnel-plot/chapter1_R/dataset.csv).

   1. Modify the script to look like [this script](./samples/funnel-plot/chapter1_R/script_R_v1_01.r) to implement input error handling and add user parameters to control the appearance of the plot.

1. Next, build a report:

   Continue to modify the script using [this script](./samples/funnel-plot/chapter2_R/script_R_v2_00.r) to comment out the *read.csv* call and instead load *dataset.csv* into the Power BI desktop workspace as the **Cancer Mortality** table. This results with the following [PBIX file](./samples/funnel-plot/chapter2_R/funnelPlot_Rvisual.pbix).

   > [!NOTE]
   > The `dataset` is a hard-coded name for the input `data.frame` of any R-visual. 

1. Create a new R-powered visual and package in R code:

   1. Before you get started, [install the PBIVIZ tools](./custom-visual-develop-tutorial.md#installing-packages).

   1. Use the command line to create a new R-powered visual:

   ```bash
   pbiviz new funnelRvisual -t rvisual
   cd funnelRvisual
   npm install 
   pbiviz package
   ```

   This creates the **funnelRvisual** folder with initial template visual (`-t` stands for _template_). The PBIVIZ is in *dist* folder. Try to import it into Power BI and see what it does. The R-code is inside *script.r* file. 

   1. Open *script.r* file and replace its contents with your script.

   1. Open *capabilities.json* and replace the `Values` string by `dataset` string. It replaces the name of "Role" in template to be like in R-code.

   ![before vs. after](./samples/funnel-plot/chapter3_R/funnelRvisual_v01/capabilities_changes.PNG)

   1. *(optional)* Open *dependencies.json* and add a section for each R package required by your R script. This tells Power BI to automatically import these packages when the visual is loaded for the first time.

   ![before vs. after](./samples/funnel-plot/chapter3_R/funnelRvisual_v01/dependencies_changes.PNG)

   1. Re-package the visual using `pbiviz package`. Try to import it into Power BI again and see what it does.

   See the above [PBIX](./samples/funnel-plot/chapter3_R/funnelPlot_RCustomVisual.pbix) and entire [Visual Project](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter3_RCustomVisual/funnelRvisual_v01/) for download.

1. Improve the R-based visual:

   The visual is not yet user-friendly, because the user has to know the order of columns in the input table, so let's divide the input field `dataset` into 3 fields (roles): `Population`, `Number` and `Tooltips`

   ![CV01to02](./media/funnel-plot/Capture01TO02.PNG)

   1. Edit *capabilities.json* by replacing `dataset` role by three new roles. You will need to update sections: `dataRoles` and `dataViewMappings`. These sections define names, types, tooltips and maximum columns for each input field, see more information [here](./capabilities.md). See the resulting [Chapter 3 resulting capabilities.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter3_RCustomVisual/funnelRvisual_v02/capabilities.json). 

   1. Edit *script.r* to support _Population_, _Number_ and _Tooltips_ as input dataframes instead of _dataset_. See the resulting [Chapter 3 resulting script.r](./samples/funnel-plot/chapter3_R/funnelRvisual_v02/script.r).

   > [!NOTE]
   > To follow the changes in R-script, search for the commented blocks: 
   > 
   > ```r
   > #RVIZ_IN_PBI_GUIDE:BEGIN: Added to enable visual fields
   > ...
   > #RVIZ_IN_PBI_GUIDE:END: Added to enable visual fields
   > 
   > #RVIZ_IN_PBI_GUIDE:BEGIN: Removed to enable visual fields 
   > ...
   > #RVIZ_IN_PBI_GUIDE:BEGIN: Removed to enable visual fields
   > ```

   1. Re-package the visual again: `pbiviz package` and try to import it into Power BI again and see what it does.

   See the [resulting PBIX](./samples/funnel-plot/chapter3_R/funnelPlot_RCustomVisual.pbix) and [whole Visual Project](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter3_RCustomVisual/funnelRvisual_v02) for download.

1. Add user parameters to the visual:

   ![CV02to03](./media/funnel-plot/Capture02TO03.PNG)

   The user obviously wants to control colors and sizes of visual elements as well as some internal parameters of algorithm from the UI, so let's add this capability: 

   1. Edit *capabilities.json* again, this time the _objects_ section, read more [here](./objects-properties.md). 

   This is the place to define names, tooltips and types of each parameter. We also decide on the partition of parameters into groups (three groups in this case). 

   The resulting file is:

   [Chapter 3 capabilities.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter3_RCustomVisual/funnelRvisual_v03/capabilities.json)

   See before vs. after ![](./samples/funnel-plot/chapter3_R/funnelRvisual_v03/capabilities_before_after.PNG)

   1. Edit the *src/settings.ts* file to match [settings.ts](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter3_RCustomVisual/funnelRvisual_v03/src/settings.ts). This file is written in TypeScript.  Don't worry, it is easy to use this example as a template.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > To follow the changes in R-script, search for the commented blocks:
   >
   > ```typescript
   > //RVIZ_IN_PBI_GUIDE:BEGIN:Added to enable user parameters 
   >  ...
   > //RVIZ_IN_PBI_GUIDE:END:Added to enable user parameters 
   > ```
 
      You will find two blocks of the code added. 
      1. Declare new interface to hold the property value; 
      1. Define a member property and default values; 

   See before vs. after ![](./samples/funnel-plot/chapter3_R/funnelRvisual_v03/settings_ts_before_after.PNG)

   1. Edit *script.r* to match [script.r](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter3_RCustomVisual/funnelRvisual_v03/script.r) and support the parameters in UI, it is quite easy just by adding `if.exists` calls per user-parameter

   > [!NOTE]
   > To follow the changes in R-script, search for the commented blocks:
   >
   > ```r
   > #RVIZ_IN_PBI_GUIDE:BEGIN:Added to enable user parameters
   >  ...
   > #RVIZ_IN_PBI_GUIDE:END:Added to enable user parameters
   >
   > #RVIZ_IN_PBI_GUIDE:BEGIN:Removed to enable user parameters 
   >  ...
   > #RVIZ_IN_PBI_GUIDE:END:Removed to enable user parameters
   > ```

   Note that you may decide not to expose some of the parameters to UI, like we did.  
 
   1. Re-package the visual again: `pbiviz package`. Try to import it into Power BI again and see what it does. 

   See the [resulting PBIX](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter3_RCustomVisual/funnelPlot_RCustomVisual.pbix) and [full source code ](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter3_RCustomVisual/funnelRvisual_v03/) for download.

   > [!NOTE]
   > In this tutorial we add parameters of several types (boolean, numeric, string, and color) at once. If you find it too complicated to follow, please have a look at [this example](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/blob/master/RVisualTutorial/PropertiesPane.md), which shows how to add a single parameter. 

1. Convert visual to RHTML-based visual:

   Since the resulting visual is PNG-based, it isn't responsive to mouse hover, can't be zoomed in, etc., so we'll show how it can be converted to HTML-based visual. We will create an empty R-powered HTML-based Visual template and then copy some scripts from the PNG-based visual project.

   1. Use command line:

   ```bash
   pbiviz new funnelRHTMLvisual -t rhtml
   cd funnelRHTMLvisual
   npm install 
   pbiviz package
   ```

   1. Explore *capabilities.json* and pay attention to `"scriptOutputType": "html"`  line.

   1. Explore *dependencies.json* and pay attention to names of R-packages listed there.

   1. Explore *script.r* and pay attention to its structure. You may open and run it in RStudio. It does not use external input. 

   You will find that it creates and saves *out.html* file. The file will have to be self-contained (without external dependencies) and defines graphics inside HTML widget. 

   To help `htmlWidgets` users we also provide R-utilities in _"r_files"_ [folder](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter4_RHTMLCustomVisual/funnelRHTMLvisual_v01/r_files) to help with conversion of `plotly` or `widget` object into self-content HTML. 
   Note that this version of R-powered visual supports `source` command (unlike previous types of visuals) and we will use it to make code more readable.   
 
   1. Replace template *capabilities.json* by *capabilities.json* from the previous step, but obviously keep:

   `"scriptOutputType": "html"`  

   The resulting file [capabilities.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter4_RHTMLCustomVisual/funnelRHTMLvisual_v01/capabilities.json)

   1. Merge the latest version of the *sript.r* file from [Chapter 3](#r-code-packaging-in-r-powered-visual) with *script.r* from the template.

   What are the changes? We use `plotly` package to convert **ggplot** object to **plotly** object. Next we use `htmlWidgets` package to save it to HTML-file. 

   We also move most of the utility functions to [_"r_files/utils.r"_](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter4_RHTMLCustomVisual/funnelRHTMLvisual_v01/r_files/utils.r) and add `generateNiceTooltips` function for cosmetics of **plotly** object.

   See resulting file [script.r](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter4_RHTMLCustomVisual/funnelRHTMLvisual_v01/script.r)

   See before vs. after ![1](./samples/funnel-plot/chapter4_R/RHTML_v01/script_befor_after_1.PNG), ![2](./samples/funnel-plot/chapter4_R/RHTML_v01/script_befor_after_2.PNG)

   > [!NOTE]
   > To follow the changes in R-script, search for the commented blocks:
   > 
   > ```r
   > #RVIZ_IN_PBI_GUIDE:BEGIN:Added to create HTML-based 
   >  ...
   > #RVIZ_IN_PBI_GUIDE:BEGIN:Added to create HTML-based
   >
   > #RVIZ_IN_PBI_GUIDE:BEGIN:Removed to create HTML-based  
   > ...
   > #RVIZ_IN_PBI_GUIDE:BEGIN:Removed to create HTML-based
   > ```

   1. Merge the latest version of the *dependencies.json* file from [Chapter 3](#r-code-packaging-in-r-powered-visual) with *dependencies.json* from the template to include new R-package dependencies.

   See resulting file [dependencies.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter4_RHTMLCustomVisual/funnelRHTMLvisual_v01/dependencies.json)

   1. Change the script *src/settings.ts* in exactly the same way as you did in [Chapter 3.3](#adding-user-parameters)

   1. Re-package the visual again: `pbiviz package`. Try to import it into Power BI again and see what it does. 

The resulting PBIX and the whole Visual Project may be found in: [Chapter 4 funnelRHTMLvisual_v01](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter4_RHTMLCustomVisual/funnelRHTMLvisual_v01)

1. Create further examples:

   1. Start by creating an empty project: 

   ```bash
   pbiviz new smallRHTML -t rhtml
   cd smallRHTML
   npm install 
   pbiviz package
   ```

   1. Take code from this [showcase](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_networkD3.html) and make the highlighted changes to it:

   ![Highlighted changes](./media/funnel-plot/CaptureNetworkD3.PNG)

   1. Copy it instead of your template *script.r* and run `pbiviz package` again. Now you get this cool visual in your Power BI report!

## Tips and Tricks

* We recommend that developers edit	*pbiviz.json* to contain correct metadata (such as _version_, _email_, _name_, _license type_ etc.).

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The `"guid"` field is the unique identifier for a visual. You should create a new project for every different visual, so the GUID will be different for each visual. It will only be the same if you are copying an old project when you create a new visual, which you should not do.

* Edit [*assets/icon.png*](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter4_RHTMLCustomVisual/funnelRHTMLvisual_v01/assets/icon.png) to create unique icons for your visual. 

* In order to be able to debug your R-code in RStudio with exactly the same data as you have in Power BI report, add the following code at the beginning of the R-script (edit `fileRda` variable):

   ```r
   #DEBUG in RStudio
   fileRda = "C:/Users/yourUserName/Temp/tempData.Rda"
   if(file.exists(dirname(fileRda)))
   {
     if(Sys.getenv("RSTUDIO")!="")
       load(file= fileRda)
     else
       save(list = ls(all.names = TRUE), file=fileRda)
   }
   ```

   This code saves the environment from Power BI report and loads it in RStudio. 

* You don't need to develop R-powered Visuals from scratch with code available in [Github](https://github.com/Microsoft?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=PowerBI&type=&language=R). Select the visual you'd like to use as a template and copy the code into a new project. For example, you can start from the [spline custom visual](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals-spline).

* Keep in mind, that each R visual and R Visual applies the `unique` operator to the input table. To avoid the identical rows being removed, consider adding an extra input field with a unique ID and just ignore it in R code.   

* If you have Power BI account, you can use Power BI service to develop your [visual on-the-fly](/PowerBI-visuals/docs/step-by-step-lab/creating-a-custom-visual/#testing-the-custom-visual) instead of re-packaging it with `pbiviz package` command.

### HTML widgets gallery
Explore visuals in the [HTML widgets gallery](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/) to use as your next visual. To make it easier, we've created a [visuals project repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter4_RHTMLCustomVisual/multipleRHTML) that contains more than 20 interactive HTML visuals.

![CV02to03](./media/funnel-plot/CaptureSample.PNG)

![CV02to03](./media/funnel-plot/CaptureSampleService.PNG)

Try it out in [PBIX file](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/tree/master/RVisualTutorial/TutorialFunnelPlot/chapter4_RHTMLCustomVisual/multipleRHTML/assets/sample.pbix). To switch between html widgets use **Format** > **Settings** > **Type**. 

To use a sample as a starting point for your visual:

1. Download the entire folder.
1. Edit *script.r* and *dependencies.json* to keep only one widget .
1. Edit *capabilities.json* and *settings.ts* to remove `Type` selector.
1. For better performance, change `const updateHTMLHead: boolean = true;` to `false` in *visual.ts*. 
1. Change the metadata in *pbiviz.json*, particularly the `"guid"` field.
1. Re-package and continue the development of visual as explained previously. 

> [!NOTE]
> Not all of the widgets in this project are supported in the service yet.
