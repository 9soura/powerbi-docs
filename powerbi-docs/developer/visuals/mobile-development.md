# How to create a mobile-friendly custom visual
Mobile consumption plays a major role in Power BI and one of its strengths is staying connected with your data anytime, anywhere. For a developer creating custom visuals, the unique constraints of each mobile device must be considered and addressed in order to reach the most users and provide them the best possible experience.

Use [Power BI app for Windows, iOS, and Android](/power-bi/consumer/mobile/mobile-apps-for-mobile-devices) to give your business users a 360Â° view of their data on the go - all at the touch of their fingertips.

## Requirements

The following requirements are essential for mobile-friendly visual development:

- Rendering

  Custom visuals need to render on all supported mobile devices, including all supported browsers and applications, with no errors in reports, dashboards, or when running **Focus** mode. 

- Interactivity

  Interactive functionality must be provided same as that for desktop devices. This means all events handled on desktop browsers must be supported or analogous event handlers provided specific to mobile devices.
  
  For example, basic navigation and the selection of data points should be implementated as is provided with desktop browsers. If a visual supports multi-selecting using the **Ctrl** key - the developer needs to consider adding a similar event handler for mobile devices.

  The following table provides a list of corresponding events on mobile devices:

  | Mouse event name | Touch event name |
  |:----------------:|:----------------:|
  | `click` | `click` |
  | `mousemove` | `touchmove` |
  | `mousedown` | `touchstart` |
  | `mouseup` | `touchend` |
  | `dblclick` | use external library |
  | `contextmenu` | use external library |
  | `mouseover` | `touchmove` |
  | `mouseout` | `touchmove` (or external library) |
  | `wheel` | `NaN` |

  > [!NOTE]
  > Not all mobile (or similarly touch screen) devices support mouse (or *mouse* prefixed) events. In such cases, both *mouse* and *touch* events need to be handled at the same time.

## Optional requirements
The following requirements are considered optional and used to create a better end-user experience.

- Rendering

  To support smaller visual sizes, try adding format options the user can change to adjust the size of each element (for example, on labels) for use in reports and dashboards. This allows users to customize a visual specifically for their mobile device. These same settings can also be applied to the visuals in desktop browsers, and if needed, be overridden to adapt the visual to the smaller screens.

  > [!NOTE]
  > To optimize a visual in **Focus** mode, both portrait and landscape orientationed screen sizes need to be considered, see [Display content in focus mode](/power-bi/consumer/end-user-focus).

- Interactivity

  Consider the addition of mobile-specific event handlers, like dragging and scrolling.

- Failover

  A visual should show a descriptive error if it cannot render on a mobile device for any reason.

## Supported browsers and devices
The custom visual must render on all devices supporting Power BI Apps, see [supported browsers for Power BI](/power-bi/power-bi-browsers) and [Power BI mobile apps](/power-bi/consumer/mobile/mobile-apps-for-mobile-devices) for more information.

When testing against the latest models of Windows, iOS, and Android devices, the developer needs to consider most of these quality aspects.
