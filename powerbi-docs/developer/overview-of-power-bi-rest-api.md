# What can developers do with the Power BI API?

[Please, rephrase the below]
Using Power BI REST API, you can create apps that embed Power BI reports or perform management tasks on Power BI reports, datasets and workspaces. For full Power BI reference go here [provide a link]. It is also possible to integrate Power BI tiles and dashboards into apps.

Developers can also build their own custom visuals that can be used in interactive reports and dashboards.

Here are some of the things you can do with the Power BI APIs.

| Embed reports, dashboards and tiles for Power BI users and Non-Power BI users. |[How to embed your Power BI dashboards, reports, and tiles](embedding-content.md) |
| Perform management tasks on Power BI objects. |[Power BI REST API reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/) |
| Create a custom visual. |[Developing a Power BI custom visual](custom-visual-develop-tutorial.md) |

> [!NOTE]
> The Power BI APIs still refer to app workspaces as groups. Any references to groups mean that you are working with app workspaces.

## Power BI Developer samples

The Power BI Developer samples include items for embedding dashboards, reports and tiles.

[Power BI Developer samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-Developer-Samples)

* Samples within **App Owns Data** are for embedding with non-Power BI users.
* Samples within **User Owns Data** are for embedding with Power BI users.

## GitHub repositories

* [.NET SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-CSharp)
* [JavaScript API](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-JavaScript)
* [Custom Visuals](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals)

## Developer tools

The following are tools you can use to aid in your development of Power BI items.

You can go through the [Embedding setup tool](https://aka.ms/embedsetup) to quickly get started and download a sample application on how to embed Power BI content.

Choose the solution that is right for you:

* [Embedding for your customers](embedding.md#embedding-for-your-customers) provides the ability to embed dashboards and reports to users who don't have an account for Power BI. Run the [Embed for your customers](https://aka.ms/embedsetup/AppOwnsData) solution.

* [Embedding for your organization](embedding.md#embedding-for-your-organization) allows you to extend the Power BI service. Run the [Embed for your organization](https://aka.ms/embedsetup/UserOwnsData) solution.

For a full sample of using the JavaScript API, you can use the [Playground tool](https://microsoft.github.io/PowerBI-JavaScript/demo). This tool is a quick way to play with different types of Power BI Embedded samples. You also can get more information about the JavaScript API by visiting the [PowerBI-JavaScript wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/powerbi-javascript/wiki) page.
