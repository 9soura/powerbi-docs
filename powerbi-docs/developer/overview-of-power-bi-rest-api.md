# What can developers do with the Power BI API?

<<<<<<< HEAD
Using Power BI REST API, you can create apps that integrate with Power BI reports, dashboards, and tiles.

With Power BI REST API, it is possible to perform management tasks on Power BI objects like reports, datasets, and workspaces.

Here are some of the things you can do with the Power BI APIs.

## Push data into Power BI

You can use the Power BI API to [push data into a dataset](walkthrough-push-data.md). This feature allows you to add a row to a table within a dataset. The new data is then reflected in tiles on a dashboard and within visuals within your report.

## Developer tools

The following are tools you can use to aid in your development of Power BI items.

You can go through the [Embedding setup tool](https://aka.ms/embedsetup) to quickly get started and download a sample application on how to embed Power BI content.

Choose the solution that is right for you:

* [Embedding for your customers](embedding.md#embedding-for-your-customers) provides the ability to embed dashboards and reports to users who don't have an account for Power BI. Run the [Embed for your customers](https://aka.ms/embedsetup/AppOwnsData) solution.

* [Embedding for your organization](embedding.md#embedding-for-your-organization) allows you to extend the Power BI service. Run the [Embed for your organization](https://aka.ms/embedsetup/UserOwnsData) solution.

For a full sample of using the JavaScript API, you can use the [Playground tool](https://microsoft.github.io/PowerBI-JavaScript/demo). This tool is a quick way to play with different types of Power BI Embedded samples. You also can get more information about the JavaScript API by visiting the [PowerBI-JavaScript wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/powerbi-javascript/wiki) page.
