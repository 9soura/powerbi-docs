**Self-service signup is disabled**    
You attempt to sign up and receive a message similar to this: 

*We can't finish signing you up. Your IT department has turned off signup for Microsoft Power BI. Contact them to complete signup.* 

**Solution**    
Your organization's [Global Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles) has disabled self-service sign up for Power BI. To finish signing up, contact your Global Administrator and ask them to [follow the instructions to enable sign-up](../admin/service-admin-disable-self-service.md). 

You may also experience this problem if you signed up for Microsoft 365 through a partner. In which case, contact the organization responsible for providing you with Microsoft 365.
