## Requirements
**Minimum Requirements:**

* .NET 4.6 Framework
* 64-bit version of Windows 7 / Windows Server 2008 R2 (or later)

**Recommended:**

* 8 Core CPU
* 8 GB Memory
* 64-bit version of Windows 2012 R2 (or later)

**Related Considerations:**

* The gateway cannot be installed on a domain controller
* If you are planning to use Windows authentication, make sure you install the gateway on a computer that is a member of the same Active Directory environment as the data source(s).
* You shouldn't install a gateway on a computer, such a laptop, that may be turned off, asleep, or not connected to the Internet because the gateway can't run under any of those circumstances. In addition, gateway performance might suffer over a wireless network.
* Analysis Services is not required to use the gateway. You can use the gateway to connect to an Analysis Services data source.
