# Use SAP HANA in Power BI Desktop
With Power BI Desktop, you can now access **SAP HANA** databases. To use **SAP HANA**, the SAP HANA ODBC driver must be installed on the local client computer in order for the Power BI Desktop **SAP HANA** data connection to work properly. You can download the SAP HANA ODBC driver from the [SAP Software Download Center](https://support.sap.com/swdc). From there, search for the SAP HANA CLIENT for Windows computers. Since the **SAP Software Download Center** changes its structure frequently, more specific guidance for navigating that site is not available.

To connect to a **SAP HANA** database, select **Get Data > Database > SAP HANA Database** as shown in the following image.

When connecting to a SAP HANA database, specify the server name and the port in the format *server:port* - the following image shows an example with a server named *ServerXYZ* and port *30015*.

You can also publish and upload reports to the Power BI Service when not using **SAP HANA** in DirectQuery mode.
