# Certify a dataset or dataflow

Your organization can certify datasets and dataflows that are the authoritative sources for critical information. Your Power BI tenant administrator can authorize certain users to certify datasets and dataflows for your organization. Certifying datasets and dataflows is a big responsibility. If you're one of the users authorized to certify datasets and dataflows, dataset and dataflow owners may contact you to certify their artifacts. This article explains the certification process you go through. For more information about endorsements in Power BI, see the [Dataset and dataflow endorsement overview](service-dataset-dataflow-endorsement-overview.md).

## Certify a dataset or dataflow

1. Make sure the person who contacted you gives you member permissions on the workspace where their dataset or dataflow resides. 

1. Carefully review the dataset or dataflow and determine whether it merits certification.

1. If you decide to certify the dataset or dataflow, go to the workspace where it resides.
 
1. Find the dataset or dataflow you are looking for, click **More options** (...), then select **Settings**.

   The images below illustrate certifying a dataflow. The procedure is identical for certifying a dataset.
