# Promote your dataflows (preview)

Power BI report creators often have access to many different dataflows. As a Power BI dataflow owner, you can help guide report creators to the reliable, high-quality dataflows by *promoting* them.

As a dataflow owner, you can promote your own dataflows when you think they're ready for wide-spread use. Likewise, any workspace member with write permissions on a workspace can promote any dataflow it contains. Promotion makes dataflows easy to find and track, and thus supports the collaborative spread of dataflows within an organization. 

When you promote a dataflow, it gets labeled at many places it appears in Power BI, and is easily visible.

## Promote a dataflow

To be promoted, your dataflow needs to be in a [new workspace experience](../service-new-workspaces.md), not a classic workspace, in the Power BI service.

1. Go to the list of dataflows in the workspace.
 
1. Select **More options** (...) on the dataflow you want to promote, then select **Settings**.

1. Expand the endorsement section and select **Promoted**.
