# Endorse your datasets and dataflows (preview)

Power BI report creators often have access to many different datasets and dataflows. As a Power BI dataset or dataflow owner, you can help guide report creators to the reliable, high-quality datasets and dataflows by *endorsing* them. Power BI provides two ways of endorsing a dataset or dataflow; promotion and certification:

- **Promotion**: As a dataset or dataflow owner, you can promote your own datasets or dataflows when you think they're ready for wide-spread use. Likewise, any workspace member with write permissions on a workspace can promote any dataset or dataflow it contains. Promotion makes datasets and dataflows easy to find and track, and thus supports the collaborative spread of dataflows and dataflows within an organization. 
- **Certification**: Certification is a way of letting report designers know that your dataset or dataflow has been reviewed and is of high quality and reliability. You don't certify your dataset or dataflow directly; rather, you request certification from an authorized reviewer. That person then reviews and decides whether or not to certify your dataset or dataflow. [Read more about certification](service-dataset-dataflow-endorsement-overview.md#certification).

When you promote or certify a dataset or dataflow, it gets labeled at many places it appears in Power BI, and is easily visible.

## Promote a dataset or dataflow

To be promoted, your dataset or dataflow needs to be in a [new workspace experience](../service-new-workspaces.md), not a classic workspace, in the Power BI service.

1. Go to the list of datasets or dataflows in the workspace.
 
1. Select **More options** (...) on the dataset or dataflow you want to promote, then select **Settings**.

   The images below illustrate how to promote a dataflow. The procedure is the same for datasets.

1. Expand the endorsement section and select **Promoted**.

1. Select **Apply**.

## Request dataset or dataflow certification

To be certified, your dataset or dataflow needs to be in a [new workspace experience](../service-new-workspaces.md), not a classic workspace, in the Power BI service.

Your tenant admin has identified people in your organization who can certify datasets and dataflows. You ask them to certify your dataset or dataflow.

1. Go to the list of datasets or dataflows in the workspace.
 
1. Select **More options** (...) on the dataset or dataflow you want to certify, then select **Settings**.

   The images below illustrate how to promote a dataflow. The procedure is the same for datasets.

   ![Select the ellipsis on the dataflow](media/service-dataflows-endorse/power-bi-dataflow-settings.png)

1. Expand the endorsement section and click **Learn more** to find out who to contact about certifying your dataset or dataflow. The Certified button is greyed out; it is available only for authorized dataset and dataflow reviewers.

2. Give the certifier member permissions for the workspace where the dataset or dataflow resides, and contact them to review and certify your dataset or dataflow.
