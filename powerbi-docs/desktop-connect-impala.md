# Connect to an Impala database in Power BI Desktop
In Power BI Desktop, you can connect to an **Impala** database and use the underlying data just like any other data source in Power BI Desktop.

## Connect to an Impala database
To connect to an **Impala** database select **Get Data** from the **Home** ribbon in Power BI Desktop. Select **Database** from the categories on the left, and you see **Impala**.

In the **Impala** window that appears, type or paste the name of your Impala server into the box, and select **OK**. Note that you can choose to **Import** data directly into Power BI, or you can use **DirectQuery**. You can learn more about [using DirectQuery](desktop-use-directquery.md).

When prompted, put in your username and password, or connect anonymously - either is supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Once you put in your username and password for a particular **Impala** server, Power BI Desktop uses those same credentials in subsequent connection attempts. You can modify those credentials by going to **File > Options and settings > Data source settings**.
> 
> 

Once you successfully connect, a **Navigator** window appears and displays the data available on the server, from which you can select one or multiple elements to import and use in **Power BI Desktop**.

## Considerations and Limitations
There are a few limits and considerations to keep in mind with the **Impala** connector:

* Future plans include enabling refresh support using the **Power BI Gateway**.
