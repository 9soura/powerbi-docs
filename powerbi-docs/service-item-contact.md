# Set contact information for reports and dashboards in Power BI service
This article teaches you how to set contact information for a dashboard or report in Power BI service.

> [!NOTE]
> Contact information can be set only for items in a classic or new workspace. You can't set a contact information for items in your My workspace.

You can add multiple users or groups to the contact for an item, these can be:
* A person
* An Office 365 Group
* An email enabled security group
* A distribution list

By default the person who created the report or dashboard is the contact for it. They are not shown in the contact list. If you set a value, it overrides the default. You can of course remove all the people or groups from the contact list to again use the default value.

The contact information is shown to people viewing the item. When you click the list of contacts, an email is created so you can ask questions or get help. The contact list information is also shown in some error scenarios on the error dialog.
