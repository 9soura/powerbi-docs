# Set contact information for reports and dashboards in the Power BI service
This article teaches you how to set contact information for a dashboard or report in the Power BI service.

> [!NOTE]
> Contact information can be set for items in a classic or new workspace. You can't set contact information for items in your My Workspace.

You can add multiple users or groups to the contact for an item. They can be:
* A person
* An Office 365 Group
* An email enabled security group
* A distribution list

By default the person who created the report or dashboard is the contact for it. They are not shown in the contact list. If you set a value, it overrides the default. You can of course remove all the people or groups from the contact list to again use the default value.

The contact information is shown to people viewing the item.

When you click the list of contacts, an email is created so you can ask questions or get help.

The contact list information is also used in other places. For example, it is shown in some error scenarios in the error dialog box. Automated email messages related to the item, like data refresh failures and access requests, are sent to the contact list. 

> [!NOTE]
> When publishing an app, the contact information set on individual items is set to the person who published or updated the app. You can set the app support URL so app users get the help they need.
