# Tutorial: Connect to on-premises data in SQL Server

An on-premises data gateway is software that you install within an on-premises network; it facilitates access to data in that network. In this tutorial you build a report in Power BI Desktop based on sample data in SQL Server. You then publish the report to the Power BI service, and configure a gateway so the the service can access the on-premises data. This access means the service can refresh the data to keep the report up to date.

If you're not signed up for Power BI, [sign up for a free trial](https://app.powerbi.com/signupredirect?pbi_source=web) before you begin.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a report from data in SQL Server
> * Publish the report to the Power BI Service
> * Add SQL Server as a gateway data source
> * Schedule refresh for the SQL Server data


## Prerequisites

* [Install Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/)
* [Install SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server) on a local computer 
* [Install an on-premises data gateway](service-gateway-install.md) on the same local computer (in production, it would typically be a different computer)


## Set up sample data

You start by adding sample data to SQL Server, so you can use that data in the rest of the tutorial.

1. In SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), connect to your instance of SQL Server and create a test database.

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE TestGatewayDocs
    ```

2. In the database you created, add a table and insert data.

    ```sql
    USE TestGatewayDocs

    CREATE TABLE Product (
        SalesDate DATE,
        Category  VARCHAR(100),
        Product VARCHAR(100),
        Sales MONEY,
        Quantity INT
    )

    INSERT INTO Product VALUES('2018-05-05','Accessories','Carrying Case',9924.60,68)
    INSERT INTO Product VALUES('2018-05-06','Accessories','Tripod',1350.00,18)
    INSERT INTO Product VALUES('2018-05-11','Accessories','Lens Adapter',1147.50,17)
    INSERT INTO Product VALUES('2018-05-05','Accessories','Mini Battery Charger',1056.00,44)
    INSERT INTO Product VALUES('2018-05-06','Accessories','Telephoto Conversion Lens',1380.00,18)
    INSERT INTO Product VALUES('2018-05-06','Accessories','USB Cable',780.00,26)
    INSERT INTO Product VALUES('2018-05-08','Accessories','Budget Movie-Maker',3798.00,9)
    INSERT INTO Product VALUES('2018-05-09','Digital video recorder','Business Videographer',10400.00,13)
    INSERT INTO Product VALUES('2018-05-10','Digital video recorder','Social Videographer',3000.00,60)
    INSERT INTO Product VALUES('2018-05-11','Digital','Advanced Digital',7234.50,39)
    INSERT INTO Product VALUES('2018-05-07','Digital','Compact Digital',10836.00,84)
    INSERT INTO Product VALUES('2018-05-08','Digital','Consumer Digital',2550.00,17)
    INSERT INTO Product VALUES('2018-05-05','Digital','Slim Digital',8357.80,44)
    INSERT INTO Product VALUES('2018-05-09','Digital SLR','SLR Camera 35mm',18530.00,34)
    INSERT INTO Product VALUES('2018-05-07','Digital SLR','SLR Camera',26576.00,88)
    ```

3. Select the data from the table to verify what you inserted.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Product
    ```

## Build and publish a report

Now that you have sample data in SQL Server, you connect to SQL Server in Power BI Desktop and build a report based on that data. You then publish the report to the Power BI service.

1. In Power BI Desktop, on the **Home** tab, select **Get Data** > **SQL Server**.

2. Under **Server** enter your server name, and under **Database** enter "TestGatewayDocs". Select **OK**. 

    ![Enter server and database](media/service-gateway-sql-tutorial/server-database.png)

3. Verify your credentials, then select **Connect**.

4. Under **Navigator**, select the **Product** table, then select **Load**.

    ![Select Product table](media/service-gateway-sql-tutorial/select-product-table.png)

5. In the Power BI Desktop **Report** view, in the **Visualizations** pane select the **Stacked column chart**.

    ![Stacked column chart](media/service-gateway-sql-tutorial/column-chart.png)    

6. With the column chart selected in the report canvas, in the **Fields** pane select the **Category** and **Sales** fields.  

    ![Select fields](media/service-gateway-sql-tutorial/select-fields.png)

    The chart should now look like the following.

    ![Select Product table](media/service-gateway-sql-tutorial/finished-chart.png)

    Notice that **SLR Camera** is the current sales leader. This will change when you update data and refresh the report later in this tutorial.

7. Save the report with the name "TestGatewayDocs.pbix".

8. On the **Home** tab select **Publish**, then select **My Workspace** > **Select**. Sign in to the Power BI service if you're asked to do so. 

    ![Publish report](media/service-gateway-sql-tutorial/publish-report.png)

9. On the **Success** screen, select **Open 'TestGatewayDocs.pbix' in Power BI**.


## Add SQL Server as a gateway data source



## Configure and use data refresh

Set up scheduled refresh
Update the data / refresh (does on-demand refresh work with gateways?)


## Clean up resources
If you don't want to use the sample data anymore, use `DROP DATABASE TestGatewayDocs` in SSMS. If you don't want to use the SQL Server data source, [remove the data source](service-gateway-manage.md#remove-a-data-source).
