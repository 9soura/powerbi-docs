# Troubleshooting sign-in issues for Power BI

This article describes how to generate [support content](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/support/) that details what path you can follow to resolve your sign in issues.

The first action you need to take is to **engage your internal support team** for assistance. However, if you are a **tenant admin** for your organization, and you until can't sign into Power BI then continue with the information below.

First, try to create a support ticket through the [Power BI support page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/support/).

If you are unable to go through the Power BI support page, then try to create a ticket via the [Office 365 (O365) support page](https://support.office.com/home/contact).

If you're unable to create a ticket either through the Power BI support page or through O365, then try to contact support via phone.

    For customers in the United States (US) and the rest of the Americas: </br>
    +1-800-936-5800

    For customers in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia (EMEA):</br>
    +44-844-800-2400

    For customers in India:</br>

Another option to contact Microsoft support for help is by purchasing [Microsoft Premier support](https://support.microsoft.com/premier).

    If you know your organization has purchased Microsoft Premier support and you still can't create a case from any O365 or Power BI channel, then you can contact Premier support via phone.
