# Troubleshooting sign-in for Power BI service

This article describes how to generate [support content](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/support/) that details what path you can follow to resolve your sign in issues.

> [!Note]
> In most cases, when you can't sign in to Power BI, the root cause is because of an issue with either your [Office 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/) or your [Azure Active Directory (AAD) account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis).

The first action you need to take is to **engage your internal support team** for assistance. However, if you are a **tenant admin** for your organization, and still can't sign into Power BI then follow the steps below.

1. Try to create a support ticket through the [Power BI support page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/support/).

2. Try to create a ticket via the [Office 365 (O365) support page](https://support.office.com/home/contact).

3. Then try to contact support via phone.

    For customers in the United States (US) and the rest of the Americas: </br>
    +1-800-936-5800

    For customers in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia (EMEA):</br>
    +44-844-800-2400

    For customers in India:</br>
    +1-800-419-5666

4. Another option to contact Microsoft support for help is by purchasing [Microsoft Premier support](https://support.microsoft.com/premier).

    If you know your organization has purchased Microsoft Premier support and you still can't create a case from any O365 or Power BI channel, then you can contact Premier support via phone.
