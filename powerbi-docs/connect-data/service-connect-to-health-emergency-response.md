# Connect to the Hospital Emergency Response Decision Support Dashboard
The Hospital Emergency Response Decision Support Dashboard template app is the reporting component of the [Microsoft Power Platform solution for healthcare emergency response](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/emergency-response-solution-a-microsoft-power-platform-solution-for-healthcare-emergency-response/). The dashboard shows emergency managers aggregate data across their health system to help them to make timely, correct decisions.

This article tells  you how to install the app and how to connect to the data sources.
