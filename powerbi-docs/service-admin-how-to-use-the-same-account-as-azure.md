# Using the same account for Power BI and Azure
If you are a user of both Power BI and Azure, you may want to use the same login for both services so that you don't need to type in your password twice.

Power BI signs you in with your organizational account, associated with your work or school email address.  Azure signs you in with either a Microsoft Account or your organizational account.

If you want to use the same login for both Azure and Power BI, be sure to sign in to Azure with your organizational account.

**What if I already sign in to Azure with my Microsoft Account?**

You can add your organizational account as a co-administrator in Azure.  Here's how:

1. Sign in to the [Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com/). If you are a user in multiple Azure directories, click **Subscriptions** and then filter to view only the directory and subscriptions you want to edit.
2. In the navigation pane, click **Settings**, click **Administrators**, and then click **Add**.
3. Enter the email address associated with your organizational account.
4. Select the subscriptions you want to access with your organizational account and then click the check mark.

Next time you sign in to the Azure Management Portal, use your organizational email address.
