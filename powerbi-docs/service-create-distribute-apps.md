# Publish apps with dashboards and reports in Power BI

In Power BI, you can create *apps* to bring related dashboards and reports together, all in one place. You create apps in *app workspaces*, where you can collaborate on Power BI content with your colleagues. Then you can publish the finished apps to large groups of people in your organization. Read more about [creating app workspaces](service-create-workspaces.md).

Your business users often need multiple Power BI dashboards and reports to run their business. Apps bring the pieces together so they don't have to remember the names and locations of all these dashboards.  

With the new app workspace experiences, now in preview, you can create collections of dashboards and reports and publish them as apps to your whole organization or to specific people or groups. For you as a report creator or admin, apps make it easier to manage permissions on collections of dashboards.

Business users get your apps in a few different ways. If the Power BI administrator gives you permission, you can install them automatically in your coworkers' Power BI accounts. Otherwise, they can install your apps from Microsoft AppSource, or you can send them a direct link. They can easily find and return to your content because it’s all in one place. They get updates automatically and you can control how frequently the data refreshes. Read more about the [app experience for business users](service-install-use-apps.md).

## Apps and organizational content packs
Apps are the evolution of organizational content packs. Content packs aren't available in the new workspace experiences preview. After the new workspace experiences is generally available, you won't be able to use content packs in newly created workspaces. If you haven'tt already, start migrating your content packs to apps.

## Workspaces
*Workspaces* are the places where you create apps, so you need to create a workspace first, before you create the app. If you’ve ever worked in a group workspace in Power BI, then app workspaces will be familiar. Read more about [creating workspaces](service-create-workspaces.md).

## Licenses for apps
Each member of an app workspace needs a Power BI Pro license. For app users, there are two options.

* Option 1: All business users need **Power BI Pro** licenses to view your app. 
* Option 2: Free users in your organization can view app content if your app resides in a Power BI Premium capacity. Read [What is Power BI Premium?](service-premium.md) for details.

## Publish your app
When the dashboards and reports in your workspace are ready, you choose which dashboards and reports you want to publish, then you publish them as an app. You can send a direct link to that wider audience, or they can find your app from the Apps tab by going to **Download and explore more apps from AppSource**. Those people can’t modify the contents of the app, but they can interact with it either in the Power BI service, or one of the mobile apps -– filtering, highlighting, and sorting the data themselves. 

1. In the workspace list view, decide which dashboards and reports you want to include in the app.

     ![Select the dashboard to publish](media/service-create-distribute-apps/power-bi-apps-incude-dashboard.png)

     If you choose not to publish a report, you see a warning next to the report and its related dashboard. You can still publish the app, but the related dashboard will be missing the tiles from that report.

     ![Warning about related dashboard](media/service-create-distribute-apps/power-bi-apps-report-warning.png)

2. Select the **Publish app** button in the upper right to start the process of sharing all the content in that workspace.
   
     ![Publish app](media/service-create-distribute-apps/power-bi-apps-publish-button.png)

3. On **Details**, fill in the description to help people find the app. You can set a background color to personalize it.
   
     ![App details](media/service-create-distribute-apps/power-bi-apps-details.png)

4. On **Content**, you see the content that’s going to be published as part of the app – everything that you've selected in that workspace. You can also set the app landing page – the dashboard or report people will see first when they go to your app. You can choose **None**. Then they’ll land on a list of all the content in the app. 
   
     ![App content](media/service-create-distribute-apps/power-bi-apps-content.png)

5. On **Access**, decide who has access to the app: either everyone in your organization, specific people,  Active Directory security groups. If you have permissions, you can decide to install the app automatically for the recipients. You can enable this setting in the [Power BI Admin Portal](#how-to-enable-pushing-apps). You can learn more considerations for [pushing an app](#how-to-enable-pushing-apps).

    ![App access](media/service-create-distribute-apps/power-bi-apps-access.png)

6. When you select **Finish**, you see a message confirming it’s ready to publish. In the success dialog box, you can copy the URL that’s a direct link to this app and send it to the people you’ve shared it with.
   
     ![App finish](media/service-create-distribute-apps/power-bi-apps-success.png)

The business users that you've published the app to can find it in a few different ways. If you can install it automatically, it appears under Apps in their Power BI account. You can send them the direct link to the app, or they can search for it in Microsoft AppSource, where they see all the apps that they can access. No matter how they get it, after that whenever they go to Apps, they’ll see this app in their list.

Read more about the [app experience for business users](service-install-use-apps.md).

## Change your published app
After you publish your app, you may want to change or update it. It’s easy to update it if you’re an admin or member of the app workspace. 

1. Open the app workspace that corresponds to the app. 
   
     ![Open workspace](media/service-create-distribute-apps/power-bi-apps-open-workspace.png)
2. Open the dashboard or the report. You see that you can make any changes you want.
   
     The app workspace is your staging area, so your changes aren't pushed live to the app until you publish again. This lets you make changes without affecting the published apps.  
 
3. Go back to the app workspace list of contents and select **Update app**.
   
     ![Update app button](media/service-create-distribute-apps/power-bi-app-update-button.png)

4. Update **Details**, **Content**, and **Access**, if you need to, then select **Update app**.
   
     ![Update app button](media/service-create-distribute-apps/power-bi-app-update-complete.png)

The people you’ve published the app to automatically see the updated version of the app. 

## Automatically install apps for end users
You can automatically install apps for end users, making it easier to distribute the right apps to the right people or groups.

Apps deliver data that your end users need to do their jobs. Now you can automatically install these apps in the Apps content list rather than you finding it from Microsoft AppSource, or following an installation link. This makes it easier for you to roll out standard Power BI content to your users.

### How to install an app automatically for end users
Once the admin has enabled the feature, the app publishers have a new option available to **install the app automatically**. When the box is ***checked*** and the application publisher selects **Finish** (or **Update app**, for existing apps), the app will be pushed to all users or groups defined in the **Permissions** section of the app on the **Access** tab.

### How users get the apps that were pushed to them
After you push an app, it shows up in the Apps list automatically. You can curate the apps that a user or job role in your organization need to have at their fingertips.

### Considerations for automatically installing apps
Here are some things to keep in mind when pushing apps to end users:

* Installing an app automatically to users can take time. Most apps will install immediately for users, but pushing apps can take time.  It depends on the number of items in the app and the number of people given access. We recommend pushing apps during off hours with plenty of time before users need them. Verify with several users before sending broad communication about the apps' availability.

* Refresh your browser. Before seeing the pushed app in the Apps list, the user may need to refresh, or close and reopen their browser.

* If the user doesn’t immediately see the app in the Apps list, they should refresh or close and reopen their browser.

* Try not to overwhelm users. Be careful not to push too may apps so your users perceive the pre-installed apps are useful to them. It’s best to control who can push apps to end users to coordinate timing. You can establish a point of contact for getting apps in your organization pushed to end users.

* Guest users who have not accepted an invite will not get apps automatically installed for them.  

## Unpublish an app
Any member of an app workspace can unpublish the app.

* In an app workspace, select the ellipsis (**...**) in the upper-right corner > **Unpublish app**.
  
     ![Unpublish app](media/service-create-distribute-apps/power-bi-app-unpublish.png)

This action uninstalls the app for everyone you've published it to, and they no longer have access to it. It doesn't delete the app workspace or its contents.
