# Purchasing Power BI Pro
Power BI Pro is for those users publishing reports, sharing dashboards, collaborating with colleagues in workspaces and engaging in other related activities – such as the ability to:

* Analyze data in Excel or Power BI Desktop
* Share with Excel Web App support
* Share dashboards and collaborate with app workspaces
* View shared content
* Integrate content with Microsoft Teams

IT Admins have a few options to use Power BI Pro within your organization. You can purchase Power BI Pro through the Office 365 admin center or through your Microsoft representative or partner. This article will look at the two trial options available for Power BI Pro, and then how to purchase as an organization.

For more information about Power BI Premium, and how Power BI Pro fits into the Premium offering, see [Power BI Premium - what is it?](service-premium.md).

## Pricing
For the latest pricing information of Power BI Pro and a table listing of included features, see [Power BI Pricing](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing/).

## In-service Power BI Pro 60 day trial for individuals
After you have signed up for your free account, you can optionally choose to try Pro free for 60 days. You will have access to all of the Pro features for the duration of the trial. Power BI Pro has all the features of the free version of Power BI, and additional sharing and collaboration features. For more information, see [Power BI Pricing](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing). To try a 60-day free trial of Power BI Pro, sign into Power BI, and try one of these Power BI Pro features:

* [Create an app worksapce](service-create-distribute-apps.md)
* [Share a dashboard](service-share-dashboards.md)

When you try any of these features, you will be prompted to start your free trial. You can also choose to make use of it by going to the gear icon and selecting **Manage personal storage**. Then select **Try Pro for free** on the right.

> [!NOTE]
> Users taking advantage of this in-product Power BI Pro trial do not appear in the Office 365 admin portal as Power BI Pro Trial users (they appear as Power BI free users). They will, however, show up as Power BI Pro Trial users in the **manage storage** page in Power BI.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are an IT Administrator wishing to acquire and deploy Power BI trial licenses to multiple users in your organization without having individual users accept trial terms individually, you can sign up for a [Power BI Pro subscription trial](https://portal.office.com/Signup/MainSignup15.aspx?OfferId=d59682f3-3e3b-4686-9c00-7c7c1c736085&dl=POWER_BI_PRO). You will need to be an Office 365 Global or Billing Admin or create a new tenant to sign up for an admin trial. For more information, see [Purchasing Power BI Pro](service-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro.md).

> [!NOTE]
> With the availability of Power BI Premium, and the changes to the Power BI Free offering on June 1, 2017, you may be eligible for an Extended Pro Trial. For more information, see [Extended Pro Trial activation](service-extended-pro-trial.md).

### What this looks like within the service
