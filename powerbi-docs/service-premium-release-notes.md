# Power BI Premium release notes
These are the release notes for Power BI Premium, a dedicated capacity giving your organization or team more dependable performance, larger data volumes, and the ability to distribute content without per-user licenses for viewers.

* Users with Power BI Free licenses can now view dashboards shared with them from Premium workspaces in the Power BI service.
* Capacity admins now automatically get capacity assignment permissions.
* Dynamic row-level security (RLS) is now available for embedded use cases. For more information, see [Row-level security (RLS) with embedded analytics](developer/embedded-row-level-security.md).
* Distributing Power BI apps to users in other AAD tenants using powerbi.com is not yet supported. We are working on enabling this.
* Users of the Personal Gateway must upgrade to the latest version in order to continue refreshing their data in Premium workspaces.
* Imported datasets greater than 1 GB are not supported in Premium capacity at initial release. We are working on enabling this.
* Users must log in at least once to the Power BI service before they can be assigned as capacity admins or given workspace assignment permissions.
* You may see transient cases where you achieve more Direct Query/live connection queries per second than what is included in your capacity SKU. You shouldn't rely on throughput above what is included in your capacity SKU.
