With a [Power BI Pro license](service-free-vs-pro.md), you can invite colleagues to view your dashboards by sharing links from the Power BI mobile apps. The people you share dashboards with need to be the same email domain as you and have a Power BI Pro license, too, or the content needs to be in a [Premium capacity](service-premium.md).

From the Power BI mobile apps for iOS and Android, you can also [annotate and share a snapshot of a tile, report, or visual](mobile-annotate-and-share-a-tile-from-the-mobile-apps.md) with anyone. 

## Share a dashboard from your iPhone
1. In the actions bar at the bottom of the dashboard, tap the share icon ![Share icon](media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-iphone-share-dashboard-icon.png).
   
   ![iPhone Share icon](media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-iphone-dashboard-invite.png)
2. Tap **Invite a colleague**.
3. Type names, separated by commas, and a message to accompany your dashboard invitation.
4. To allow resharing, leave **Allow recipients to share this dashboard** selected.
   
   Resharing allows your colleagues to forward the email invitation to others in your organization, either through the web or the mobile apps.
5. Tap **Send** in the upper-right corner.
   
   Your colleagues get an email invitation with a direct link to the dashboard. The invitation expires after one month. When they open it, in a browser or in the Power BI mobile app, it's added to the **Shared with me** section of their Power BI account.
