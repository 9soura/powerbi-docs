# Configure workloads in a Premium capacity

## Configure workloads

By default, capacities support only the workload associated with running Power BI queries. Query workloads are optimized for and limited by resources determined by your Premium capacity SKU. 

For P1-P3 SKUs, you can also enable and configure additional workloads for [Dataflows](service-dataflows-overview.md) and [Paginated reports](paginated-reports-report-builder-power-bi.md). If enabled, these workloads can impact capacity resources. To learn more, see [Premium capacity resource management and optimization](service-premium-understand-how-it-works.md).

### To configure workloads in the Power BI admin portal

1. In **Capacity settings** > **PREMIUM CAPACITIES**, select a capacity.

1. Under **MORE OPTIONS**, expand **Workloads**.

1. Enable one or more workloads, and set a value for **Max Memory**.   
Max memory settings are not cumulative. They represent a percentage of overall memory that *can be used* for that workload.
