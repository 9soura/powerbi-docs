# Use datasets across workspaces (Preview)

Business intelligence is a collaborative activity. Learn how members of your organization can share datasets with report creators across your organization. Then they can build reports based on those datasets in their own workspaces.

It's important to establish standardized datasets that can be the 'one source of truth.' Discovering and reusing existing datasets is key. When expert data modelers in your organization create and share optimized datasets, report creators can start with those datasets to build accurate reports. The organization has consistent data for decisions and a healthy data culture.

Power BI makes it easy for dataset owners to certify or promote datasets so others can discover them. Then report authors to find quality, official datasets they can use wherever they are in Power BI. As a dataset owner, you can keep control of who has access to the data by using the [Build permission](service-datasets-build-permissions.md). Tenant administrators have a new tenant setting to [govern the use of datasets across workspaces](service-datasets-admin-across-workspaces.md).

## Dataset sharing and the new workspace experience

Building reports based on datasets in different workspaces, and copying reports to different workspaces are tightly coupled with the new workspace experience:
- In the service, the Dataset Catalog only shows datasets that are in My Workspace or the new workspace experience workspaces. When you open the dataset catalog from a classic workspace, you only see the datasets in that workspace, not the ones in other workspaces.
- In the Desktop, you can publish Live Connect reports to different workspaces, as long as their datasets are in new experience workspaces.
- When copying reports across workspaces, the target workspace needs to be a new experience workspace.

## Build permission for datasets

With the Build permission type, you can allow others in your organization to build new content, such as reports, dashboards, and pinned tiles from Q&A, on an existing dataset. They can also build new content on the dataset outside Power BI, such as Excel sheets via Analyze in Excel, XMLA, and export. Read more about [Build permissions for shared datasets (Preview)](service-datasets-build-permissions.md).

## Discover datasets (Preview)

When building a report on top of an existing dataset, the first step is to connect to the dataset, either in the Power service or Power BI Desktop. Read about [discovering datasets from different workspaces (Preview)](service-datasets-discover-across-workspaces.md)

## Copy a report

When you find a report you like, in a workspace or an app, you can make a copy of it, and then modify it to fit your needs. You don't have to worry about creating the data model. That's already created for you. And it's much easier to modify an existing report than it is to start from scratch. Read more about [copying a report](service-datasets-copy-reports.md).

## Promotion and certification

If you create datasets, you can make it easier for others to discover them by [promoting a dataset](service-datasets-promote.md) when you create one that others can benefit from. You can also request that experts in your organization [certify your dataset](service-datasets-certify.md).

## Considerations and limitations

- Building a report on top of a dataset in a different workspace requires the new workspace experience at both ends: the report needs to be in a new workspace experience and the dataset needs to be in a new workspace experience.
- In a classic workspace, the dataset discovery experience only shows the datasets in that workspace.
- You can create reports in app workspaces that are based on datasets in a different workspace. However, you can't create an app for a workspace that contains those datasets.
- Free users in Desktop only see datasets from My Workspace and from Premium-based workspaces.
- If you want to add a report based on a shared dataset to an app, you have to be a member of the dataset workspace. This is a known issue.
- “Publish to web” doesn’t work for a report based on a shared dataset. This is by design.
