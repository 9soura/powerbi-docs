# Data sources in Power BI Desktop
With Power BI Desktop, you can connect to data from many different sources. A full list of available data sources is at the bottom of this page.

To connect to data, select **Get Data** from the **Home** ribbon. Selecting the down arrow, or the **Get Data** text on the button, shows the **Most Common** data types menu shown in the following image.

Selecting **More…** from the **Most Common** menu displays the **Get Data** window. You can also bring up the **Get Data** window (and bypass the **Most Common** menu) by selecting the **Get Data** **icon button** directly.

> **Note:** The Power BI team is continually expanding the data sources available to **Power BI Desktop** and the **Power BI service**. As such, you'll often see early versions of work-in-progress data sources marked as *Beta* or *Preview*. Any data source marked as *Beta* or *Preview* has limited support and functionality, and should not be used in production environments.

## Data Sources

> **Note:** Some database connectors require that you enable them by selecting **File > Options and settings > Options** then selecting **Preview Features** and enabling the connector. If you don't see some of the connectors mentioned above and want to use them, check your **Preview Features** settings. Also note that any data source marked as *Beta* or *Preview* has limited support and functionality, and should not be used in production environments.

## Connecting to a Data Source
To connect to a data source, select the data source from the **Get Data** window and select **Connect**. In the following image, **Web** is selected from the **Other** data connection category.

![](media/desktop-data-sources/data-sources_7b.png)

A connection window is displayed, specific to the type of data connection. If credentials are required, you’ll be prompted to provide them. The following image shows a URL being entered to connect to a Web data source.

![](media/desktop-data-sources/datasources_fromwebbox.png)

When the URL or resource connection information is entered, select **OK**. Power BI Desktop makes the connection to the data source, and presents the available data sources in the **Navigator**.

You can either load the data by selecting the **Load** button at the bottom of the **Navigator** pane, or edit the query before loading data by selecting the **Edit** button.

That’s all there is to connecting to data sources in Power BI Desktop! Try connecting to data from our growing list of data sources, and check back often - we continue to add to this list all the time.
