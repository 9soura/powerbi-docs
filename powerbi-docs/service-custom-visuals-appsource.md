What is AppSource? Simply put, it is the place to find apps, add-ins, and extensions for your Microsoft software. [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com) connects millions of users of products like Office 365, Azure, Dyanmics 365, Cortana, and Power BI to solutions that help them get work done more efficiently, more insightfully, or more beautifully than before.

## Power BI custom visuals
1. To see the list of available Power BI custom visuals, select **Apps**.

2. This takes you to the [Apps results page](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps) where you can view top apps in each category, including *Power BI Apps*. But we're looking for custom visuals, so let's narrow down the results by selecting **Power BI visuals** from the left navigation list.

3. AppSource displays a tile for each custom visual.  Each tile has a snapshot of the custom visual and gives a brief description and a download link. To see more details, select the tile.
