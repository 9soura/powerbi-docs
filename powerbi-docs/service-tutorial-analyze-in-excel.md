# Tutorial: Use Analyze in Excel

Your organization makes use of Power BI to share access to data. You can make use of the Analyze in Excel feature to create PivotTable and PivotCharts that bring additional context to your analytics or to reduce the time taken to find and import datasets important to your organization.  

To get started to select a dataset, select 'Analyze in Excel'. You'll be guided to creating a PivotTable that uses the data.  

You can find additional datasets shared by your organization by returning to powerbi.com/datasets.

If you encounter issues at any point, please select No at the appropriate step in the flow below and provide feedback in the linked form.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* A Power BI account. If you're not signed up for Power BI, [sign up for a free trial](https://app.powerbi.com/signupredirect?pbi_source=web) before you begin.

* Please ensure you are comfortable with all the steps listed in the [Get started with the Power BI service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-get-started) tutorial.

* You will need a Power BI Premium dataset and a Power BI Pro license, please visit [What is Power BI Premium?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-premium-what-is) for more information.

* A full list of prerequisites may be found in the comprehensive [Analyze in Excel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-analyze-in-excel#requirements) document.

Please start by navigating to the [Datasets](https://powerbi.com/datasets) page, and ensure you have a valid dataset to use.

## Download and Open the ODC File

Please select your dataset from the corresponding list and associated workspace and then click Analyze in Excel. Power BI will create an .ODC file and download it from the browser to your computer.

When you open the file in Excel, an empty PivotTable and Fields list appears with the tables, fields, and measures from the Power BI dataset. You can create PivotTables, charts, and analyze that dataset just as you would work with a local dataset in Excel.

## Enable Data Connections

In order to analyze Power BI data in Excel you may be prompted to trust the connection. Please note that administrators can disable the use of Analyze in Excel with on-premises datasets on Analysis Services Databases from the Power BI Admin Portal.

## Install Updates and Authenticate
You may also be required to authenticate with your Power BI account the first time you open a new .ODC file.  If you have issues please visit the the comprehensive [Analyze in Excel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-analyze-in-excel#sign-in-to-power-bi ) document for more information or click No during the workflow.

## Analyze Away
Similar to other local workbooks, Analyze in Excel allows you to create PivotTables, charts, add data, and create different worksheets with views into your data. Please note that Analyze in Excel exposes all detail-level data to any users with permission to the dataset. You can save this workbook like any other, but cannot publish or import it back into Power BI, and share it with other users in your organization. For more information and other use cases please visit [Analyze in Excel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-analyze-in-excel#analyze-away).

## Clean Up Resources
Interactions with the Power BI Service and Datasets page should be limited to downloading the ODC file and clicking through the workflow. If you have trouble with any of these steps, please indicate **No** on the appropriate step and provide feedback in the linked form. The form will also contain a link to more information about the issue. If you would like to retry the process or select another dataset, please revisit the Datasets page.
